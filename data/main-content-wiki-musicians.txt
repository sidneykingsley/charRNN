Ron Block described Lonely Runs Both Ways as "pretty much... what we've always done" in terms of song selection and the style, in which those songs were recorded.[41] secondnameplaceholder believes the group "was probably the most unprepared we've ever been" for the album and that songs were chosen as needed rather than planned beforehand.[17] She also performed a duet with Brad Paisley on his album Mud on the Tires in the single "Whiskey Lullaby". The single was quickly ranked in the top fifty of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top five of the Hot Country Songs, and won the Country Music Association Awards for "Best Musical Event" and "Best Music Video" of the year.\n

Few in his audiences are regular classical music attendees and it could be seen as promising that, via secondnameplaceholder, they are listening to standards of the classical canon. The fact that secondnameplaceholder's focus is on highly accessible, enjoyable repertoire is not an argument against his musical credentials."[23]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder OMRI OMDSM (Italian: [anˈdreːa boˈtʃɛlli]; born 22 September 1958)[1] is an Italian opera tenor and multi-instrumentalist.[2][3] He was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma at 5 months old, and became completely blind at age 12, following a football accident.

In October, an ARS live performance from Studio One was released as the double live set Are You Ready. Besides the group's hits and popular tracks up to that time, the album also contained the fan favorite "Another Man's Woman".\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Boys from Doraville (August 1980) showed a steep falling off in sales for the group as radio programmers began turning their attention away from Southern rock to other rock genres, such as new wave. The album provided no hit singles and was their last for Polydor. Another reason for the drop-off in sales may have been the departure of their advocate, Arnie Geller, from Polydor in 1977 to form the Buie/Gellar Organization and BGO Records with Buddy Buie. As a result, the group departed Polydor, which led to a breach of contract lawsuit from the company that was later settled in the band's favor.\n

                                                                                                                                                                           In 1982 ARS worked on a second album for CBS, to be titled Longing For A Feeling. Before completion, CBS wanted the band to drop some of the tracks and record more. Buie and the band refused, the album was shelved, and CBS dropped its contract with ARS.[5] Late in 1982, singer Ronnie Hammond decided to leave ARS for a solo career, joined by Buie (who ceased managing the ARS), though their work with Alabama musicians never resulted in commercial release. After buying out his partners, Buie continued to run Studio One until 1986 when he sold it to Georgia State University. Unfortunately, the cost of running the studio was too high and it was closed in 1989. Buie died at age 74 on July 18, 2015.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Drummer Roy Yeager tripped over a fallen tree while the band was on tour in Daytona Beach in 1982 and suffered a severe broken leg. One of the band's road crew, Danny Biget, took over on drums, and ARS persuaded Rodney Justo to return to do some shows in early 1983. Justo had moved from session singer to lead singer again in the mid-1970s with a group from Alabama called Beaverteeth. He then left the music industry for a number of years and eventually took up a sales position with a wine company.\n
                                                                 During 1983–1984, the group went to Nashville and tried working with Buddy Buie's former associate Chips Moman, a more country-oriented producer, on a proposed new record label called Triad, in conjunction with producer Buddy Killen and former Capricorn Records head Phil Walden. But results were slow to come and, dissatisfied with this direction, bassist Paul Goddard and drummer Biget left to work with British producer Eddy Offord in another band with former Dixie Dregs keyboardist T Lavitz and guitarist Pat Buchanan, called Interpol, that was in a more progressive rock direction; unfortunately, Interpol never got off the ground. The Chips Moman Nashville project, which was given the tentative name Hardball, was completed but the album, like their previous effort for CBS, has never been released.\n

Greenville, South Carolina, native Andy Anderson, who'd  been playing with Billy Joe Royal, was recommended by his friend Hamrick in 1984 as the new front man and sang on the unreleased Moman project after Justo was let go.\n

But Logan's higher voice didn't fit with the band's musical style and Anderson soon returned as lead vocalist. Bassist Stribling went on to leave in February 1986, turning it over to Steve Stone.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In late 1986, J. R. Cobb left to concentrate more on songwriting and session work at Moman's new studio in Memphis (for The Highwaymen, among others) and Stribling came back to play guitar. The personnel shuffles continued as Hamrick also departed in late 1986 and was replaced by Sean Burke (who joined in early 1987). Another new lead singer, Shaun Williamson, was rolled in in 1987. In 1988, Williamson, Stribling and Stone were all let go as Bailey and Daughtry sought to revamp the band by bringing back Ronnie Hammond.\n

E. Garnett (bass), to produce a new album with Buddy Buie and Rodney Mills that had more of an "'80s rock sound".\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Released in October 1989 on the CBS/Epic subsidiary label Imagine, Truth in a Structured Form,  ARS's first album in eight years, featured a heavy drum sound that propelled almost every track and a sharper, more synthesized gloss over the songs, with all, except one, being written by Buddy Buie and Ronnie Hammond, another departure from their previous approach. O'Brien, who was co-producer as well as guitarist on the album, was invited to go on the road with the band but he declined, preferring to continue his career in session work (today he is a much in demand producer, having worked with Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen).\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Steve Stone then returned, as guitarist this time. But album sales for Truth lagged and there was another hiatus in their recorded work as the band continued to tour, with Burke's friend Justin Senker replacing Garnett on bass in May 1992 (after subbing a show for him late the previous year in Louisville, Kentucky) and R.J. Vealey taking over the drum chair from Burke in 1995 after the latter suffered a leg injury.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In 1995 the group went back into the studio, this time to re-record some of their classic songs. This new collection was recorded in North Carolina and the resulting live-in-studio sound of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder '96 (released on CMC International in April 1996) presented a different, less polished take on some of their classic tunes and captured the sound of their live performances from that period. It was also around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band, joined by "classic era" members Cobb, Nix and Goddard, was honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center.\n

It featured some new songs and more remakes of some classics.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On December 28, 1998, singer Ronnie Hammond, who had battled alcoholism and depression off and on over the years, got into a confrontation with police in Macon, Georgia, and forced an officer to shoot him. Hammond was seriously injured, but survived the injury and dealt with the depression.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The band's fifteenth album, Eufaula, was released in February 1999 but problems occurred almost immediately as the record label, Platinum Entertainment, faced financial troubles and was not able to support the album as intended.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ARS continued to tour on a limited basis. But on November 13, 1999, tragedy struck. After the band had finished an afternoon set at a concert festival in Orlando, Florida, 37-year-old drummer R. J. Vealey complained of indigestion and then collapsed and died of a heart attack. "It was very sudden, very shocking", said guitarist Barry Bailey. "He was a great drummer, the best drummer this band ever had." ARS then continued on upon recruiting new drummer Jim Keeling.\n
                                                                                                                                                     In early 1999, with Hammond hospitalized, Andy Anderson returned to front the band until Hammond was well enough to return. Anderson would return again in May 2000 to sub another show for Ronnie. In 2001, Anderson was back again after Ronnie decided to take a gig with another group, Voices of Classic Rock. Ronnie left touring altogether soon afterward to focus on family and songwriting. A retirement show for Ronnie was held on December 6, 2002, at the club Whiskey River in Macon. Ronnie performed, backed by Dean Daughtry, Justin Senker, Steve Stone, Jim Keeling, Wendall Cox (from Travis Tritt's band) and Mike Causey (from Stillwater). Hammond died on March 14, 2011, in Forsyth, Georgia, at age 60 of heart failure.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In early 2006, Barry Bailey, suffering from multiple sclerosis, retired from the group to take care of his wife, who was sick with cancer (which took her life on July 6, 2006). Steve Stone played most of the lead from this point on and Andy Anderson's long-time Billy Joe Royal bandmate and golf buddy, Alan Accardi, was brought in as second guitarist. Alan, a Nashville veteran, would stay with the band for more than a year but it was clear that a player with more of a rock sound was needed, so a friend of Jim Keeling, Huntsville, Alabama, native David Anderson, from the band Brother Cane, was brought in as the new guitarist in April 2007.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               On March 26, 2008, singer Andy Anderson suffered a heart attack just before he was to catch a plane to Las Vegas to join the band for a two-night stand at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. Andy's friend Steve Croson (who'd played alongside him for years in Billy Joe Royal's band) lived in Vegas and was able to step in on short notice. In April and May, original singer Rodney Justo returned, joined by ARS's 1987–88 singer Shaun Williamson, until Andy was healthy enough to return in May.\n

Paul's second tenure with the band was short-lived as he died of cancer on April 29, 2014.\n

Keeling, who left ARS to spend more time with his family, was replaced in March 2016 by Justo's friend Rodger Stephan (who had also played drums with Marty Balin).[4]\n

And from August to October of that same year, singer Andy Anderson returned to the band yet again to stand in for Justo, who was recovering from back surgery.[4]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The band still tours, playing mostly festivals and nostalgia-themed concerts.\n

The album also featured guest performances by Rodney Justo and Paul Goddard, just before they rejoined the group, and Ronnie Hammond, in his final recorded appearance.\n

E. Garnett (bass), to produce a new album with Buddy Buie and Rodney Mills that had more of an "'80s rock sound".\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Released in October 1989 on the CBS/Epic subsidiary label Imagine, Truth in a Structured Form,  ARS's first album in eight years, featured a heavy drum sound that propelled almost every track and a sharper, more synthesized gloss over the songs, with all, except one, being written by Buddy Buie and Ronnie Hammond, another departure from their previous approach. O'Brien, who was co-producer as well as guitarist on the album, was invited to go on the road with the band but he declined, preferring to continue his career in session work (today he is a much in demand producer, having worked with Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam and Bruce Springsteen).\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Steve Stone then returned, as guitarist this time. But album sales for Truth lagged and there was another hiatus in their recorded work as the band continued to tour, with Burke's friend Justin Senker replacing Garnett on bass in May 1992 (after subbing a show for him late the previous year in Louisville, Kentucky) and R.J. Vealey taking over the drum chair from Burke in 1995 after the latter suffered a leg injury.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In 1995 the group went back into the studio, this time to re-record some of their classic songs. This new collection was recorded in North Carolina and the resulting live-in-studio sound of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder '96 (released on CMC International in April 1996) presented a different, less polished take on some of their classic tunes and captured the sound of their live performances from that period. It was also around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band, joined by "classic era" members Cobb, Nix and Goddard, was honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ARS then recorded Partly Plugged, which was released in January 1997 on the independent Southern Tracks label. It featured some new songs and more remakes of some classics.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On December 28, 1998, singer Ronnie Hammond, who had battled alcoholism and depression off and on over the years, got into a confrontation with police in Macon, Georgia, and forced an officer to shoot him. Hammond was seriously injured, but survived the injury and dealt with the depression.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The band's fifteenth album, Eufaula, was released in February 1999 but problems occurred almost immediately as the record label, Platinum Entertainment, faced financial troubles and was not able to support the album as intended.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ARS continued to tour on a limited basis. But on November 13, 1999, tragedy struck. After the band had finished an afternoon set at a concert festival in Orlando, Florida, 37-year-old drummer R. J. Vealey complained of indigestion and then collapsed and died of a heart attack. "It was very sudden, very shocking", said guitarist Barry Bailey. "He was a great drummer, the best drummer this band ever had." ARS then continued on upon recruiting new drummer Jim Keeling.\n
                                                                                                                                                     In early 1999, with Hammond hospitalized, Andy Anderson returned to front the band until Hammond was well enough to return. Anderson would return again in May 2000 to sub another show for Ronnie. In 2001, Anderson was back again after Ronnie decided to take a gig with another group, Voices of Classic Rock. Ronnie left touring altogether soon afterward to focus on family and songwriting. A retirement show for Ronnie was held on December 6, 2002, at the club Whiskey River in Macon. Ronnie performed, backed by Dean Daughtry, Justin Senker, Steve Stone, Jim Keeling, Wendall Cox (from Travis Tritt's band) and Mike Causey (from Stillwater). Hammond died on March 14, 2011, in Forsyth, Georgia, at age 60 of heart failure.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In early 2006, Barry Bailey, suffering from multiple sclerosis, retired from the group to take care of his wife, who was sick with cancer (which took her life on July 6, 2006). Steve Stone played most of the lead from this point on and Andy Anderson's long-time Billy Joe Royal bandmate and golf buddy, Alan Accardi, was brought in as second guitarist. Alan, a Nashville veteran, would stay with the band for more than a year but it was clear that a player with more of a rock sound was needed, so a friend of Jim Keeling, Huntsville, Alabama, native David Anderson, from the band Brother Cane, was brought in as the new guitarist in April 2007.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In 2006 former ARS drummer Roy Yeager was involved in a controversy concerning the destruction of a Tennessee American Civil War landmark.[6]\n

Andy's friend Steve Croson (who'd played alongside him for years in Billy Joe Royal's band) lived in Vegas and was able to step in on short notice. In April and May, original singer Rodney Justo returned, joined by ARS's 1987–88 singer Shaun Williamson, until Andy was healthy enough to return in May.\n

The album also featured guest performances by Rodney Justo and Paul Goddard, just before they rejoined the group, and Ronnie Hammond, in his final recorded appearance.\n

                                                 After his release from jail, secondnameplaceholder left gang life and began a musical career at the beginning of the 1960s in singing groups. He first released "Too Far to Turn Around" in 1960 as part of The Upfronts[12] before working for various small independent labels in Los Angeles. He also recorded several singles under his own name in the early 1960s, backed by vocal groups the Atlantics (for the Rampart and Faro labels) and the Majestics (for the Linda and Jordan labels).[12]  secondnameplaceholder had no involvement with Bob & Earl's 1963 hit single "Harlem Shuffle", a song he has sometimes been credited with producing;[8][13] in his 1999 autobiography, secondnameplaceholder confirmed the song had been produced by Gene Page, who had worked with him on many of secondnameplaceholder's 1970s successes.\n

              In the mid-'60s, Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records hired him as an A&R man for his new Bronco Records imprint, and secondnameplaceholder started working with the label's artists, including Viola Wills and The Bobby Fuller Four, as a songwriter, session musician, and arranger.[3] He discovered singer Felice Taylor and arranged her song "I Feel Love Comin' On" co-written with his friend Paul Politi. It became a big hit in the UK.[7] Other charting hits written by secondnameplaceholder and Politi for her included "It May Be Winter Outside (But in My Heart It's Spring)" and "Under the Influence of Love". Bronco issued one of secondnameplaceholder's first singles, 1967's "All in the Run of a Day," produced by Keane and secondnameplaceholder.[17] secondnameplaceholder also wrote "Doin' the Banana Split" for TV bubblegum act The Banana Splits in 1968.[18]\n

His friend Paul Politi hooked him up with music industry businessman Larry Nunes, who helped to finance their album. After it was recorded, Nunes took the recording to Russ Regan, who was the head of the Uni label owned by MCA. The album, 1972's From A Girl's Point of View We Give to You... Love Unlimited, became the first of secondnameplaceholder's string of long-titled albums and singles.\n

It became secondnameplaceholder's first million selling single as a writer and producer. This single also reached No. 12 in the UK chart. secondnameplaceholder's voice can clearly be heard in this piece as he plays the lover who answers the phone call of the female lead.[3]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                           Soon after, Regan left Uni for 20th Century Records. Without Regan, secondnameplaceholder's relationship with Uni soured. With his relationship with Uni over and Love Unlimited contract-bound with the label, secondnameplaceholder was able to switch both his production deal and the group to 20th Century Records. They recorded several other hits throughout the 1970s, "I Belong to You", which spent over five months on the Billboard R&B chart in 1974 including a week at No. 1 and "Under the Influence of Love Unlimited", which hit No. 3 on the Billboard Pop album charts.  secondnameplaceholder married the lead singer of the group, Glodean James, on July 4, 1974.\n
 In 1973, secondnameplaceholder created The Love Unlimited Orchestra, a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group Love Unlimited. However, secondnameplaceholder had other plans, and in 1973 he released a single with "Love's Theme" (written by him and played by the Orchestra), which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, Rhapsody in secondnameplaceholder, containing "Love's Theme". secondnameplaceholder would continue to make albums with the Orchestra, achieving some successes such as: "Rhapsody in secondnameplaceholder"; "Satin Soul"; "Forever in Love"; "Midnight Groove"; "My Sweet Summer Suite", Remake of "Theme From King Kong". The Orchestra ceased to make albums in 1983, but continued to support secondnameplaceholder as a backing band.\n

While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, secondnameplaceholder was finally persuaded to release the songs himself, although he was initially reluctant to step out behind the microphone.\n

He was going to use the name "secondnameplaceholder Heat," but decided on using his given name instead. secondnameplaceholder was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became secondnameplaceholder's first solo album, 1973's I've Got So Much to Give. It included the title track and his first solo chart hit, "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby",[3] which also rose to No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts as well as No. 3 on the Billboard Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks.[20]\n

Despite several albums over the next three years, he failed to repeat his earlier successes, with no singles managing to reach the Billboard Hot 100, except for 1982's "Change," climbing into the Billboard R&B Top 20 (No. 12). His label venture was exacting a heavy financial cost on secondnameplaceholder, so he concentrated on mostly touring and finally folded his label in 1983.\n

The demos were produced by Adam Sieff and just featured Adamson, Parker and Watson. Adamson had asked bassist Dave Allen from Gang of Four to join the band but he declined. Adamson asked Parker to join the band, which led to eight months of rehearsal in Dunfermline in a disused furniture warehouse.\n

The band then played live with Alice Cooper's Special Forces tour for two concerts in 1982 at The Brighton Centre.\n

They immediately hit it off with Adamson and Watson, who invited them to join the band.[2]\n
                                                firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's first single was "Harvest Home", recorded and released in 1982.[1] It was a modest success, although it did not reach the UK Singles Chart.[3] Their next single was 1983's "Fields Of Fire (400 Miles)", which reached the UK's Top Ten and was rapidly followed by the album The Crossing.[3] The album was a hit in the United States (reaching the Top 20 in the Billboard 200), powered by "In a firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder", their only US Top 40 hit single.[1] The song features heavily engineered guitar sounds, strongly reminiscent of bagpipes;[1] Adamson and fellow guitarist, Watson, achieved this through the use of the MXR Pitch Transposer 129 Guitar Effect. Also contributing to the band's unique sound was their use of the e-bow, a device which allows a guitar to sound more like strings or synthesizer. The Crossing sold over a million copies in the UK and obtained gold record status (sales of over 500,000) in the US. The band performed at the Grammy Awards and on Saturday Night Live.\n

The song, considered by some critics to be one of their finest,[4][5] was a Top Ten hit (No. 8) in the UK Singles Chart[3] but, despite heavy airplay and a positive critical response, was a comparative flop in the US, reaching only No. 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was the last single by the band to make the US charts.\n

They also recorded prolifically, and provided the musical score to a Scottish independent film, Restless Natives (1985), which was released years later on the band's Restless Natives and Rarities (1998) collection.  firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had backed Roger Daltrey on his 1985 solo album Under the Raging Moon, and Tony Butler played bass and provided backing vocals on Pete Townshend's 1980 hit single "Let My Love Open the Door" and the Pretenders' 1982 hit single "Back On The Chain Gang".  Both Butler and Brzezicki performed on Townshend's 1985 solo album White City: A Novel. Brzezicki played drums for The Cult on their 1985 Love album and was featured in the video for the single, "She Sells Sanctuary".\n

In the US, The Seer sold a little bit better than Steeltown, reaching No. 59 on the Billboard chart.[7]\n

It reached No. 9 in the UK Albums Chart,[3] but sold poorly in the United States.[9] \nThe album launch took place in Moscow and was accompanied by a tour of the USSR,[10] a political statement some felt seemed insincere.[11] During the Peace in Our Time world tour, the band were supported by Diesel Park West and Cry Before Dawn.[12]\n

Drummer Mark Brzezicki returned to the studio as a session drummer after leaving the band. The album found firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder trying to reinvent themselves and shift away from their 1980s image.[1]  It was not a commercial success and was not released in America, although two re-recorded tracks showed up on 1993's The Buffalo Skinners.\n

After that, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder became a minor act, popping up in the lower echelons of the charts in the UK and Europe with the release of every subsequent album.[1] Only one of these, 1993's The Buffalo Skinners, received a major label release (via Chrysalis Records), and it seemed a return to form of sorts for the band, reaching the UK Top 25.[3] The album obtained enthusiastic critical response, and although it produced two UK Top 30 singles in "Alone" and "Ships",[3] its sales were meagre.\n

Adamson split with his first wife, who later spoke to Scottish and English tabloid newspapers about his heavy drinking. He moved to Nashville in the mid-1990s where he took up residence and married a hairdresser. While in Nashville he met country music singer/songwriter Marcus Hummon, and together they released an alternative country studio album as The Raphaels in 2001 (four months before Adamson's death).\n

Numerous appeals were put on the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder website asking for Adamson to call home and speak to anyone in the band, the management company, or his ex-wife. The website also requested that any fans who might have been 'harbouring' the singer to contact the management company and alert them to his whereabouts. Mark Brzezicki and Tony Butler had indicated they were concerned but the reason firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had lasted so long was they stayed out of one another's personal lives, and both later noted they were unaware of the extent of Adamson's problems. He was found dead in a room at the Best Western Plaza Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii on 16 December 2001.[15][16][17]\n

They also released a new album, Twenty Five Live, on the Track Records label.[18] After the anniversary activity, the band returned to their hiatus.[19]\n

The efforts resulted in the creation of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's first single in 11 years, entitled "Another secondnameplaceholder".[21]\n
 In a September 2012 press release, Bruce Watson announced that Butler had retired from the group at the end of their last tour. He was replaced by former Simple Minds bassist Derek Forbes, who was Adamson's original choice for bassist on the initial firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder recordings, although Forbes was not asked due to shyness on Adamson's part.[22] The group also parted ways with longtime manager Ian Grant at the same time as Butler's departure.[23] With the involvement of Forbes, later in 2012 and into 2013, the group recorded a new album in the Welsh town of Wrexham. The new material featured lyrics composed by Peters over band-written music; Butler still held writing credits on most of the album, with Forbes having contributed on a number of tracks as well, although he played all the album's bass parts.[24] Titled The Journey, the album was released through Cherry Red Records in 2013, becoming the group's first studio record since 1999.[25] Further performances followed throughout the year, including a month-long North American tour between July and August.\n
                                                                                                                                                    On 9 November 2013, Mike Peters departed firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. The band attributed Peters' departure to his inability to commit fully to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, much of his time being devoted to The Alarm and solo projects. Initially, the band intended to continue as a four-piece, sharing lead vocals and returning all the songs to their original keys; Peters had required the songs to be tuned lower to accommodate his deeper voice.[26] However, when they resurfaced in December 2013, they were joined by English singer Simon Hough, who performed most of the lead vocals as well as harmonica and additional guitar.[27][28] While the status of Hough's membership was not immediately clarified, in a March 2014 podcast, Bruce Watson confirmed that Hough was now the band's fifth member. He also indicated that the group was working on new material, which would involve Hough, for potential future release.[29]\n

The group broke up in early 1975, and reorganized with a new lineup 18 years later following a reunion concert at the University of Missouri. In its first era, the band's musical style drew on the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Byrds. firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder produced a style that foreshadowed the alternative rock of the 1980s and 1990s. Before they broke up, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder created a "seminal body of work that never stopped inspiring succeeding generations", in the words of Rolling Stone,[1] as the "quintessential American power pop band", and "one of the most mythic and influential cult acts in all of rock & roll".[2] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by enthusiastic reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records, and limited distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration took its toll on band relations: Bell left not long after the first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1 Record, Radio City received excellent reviews,[3] but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution.\n

Four years later, the first two firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success, but has since become a cult classic. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27.\n

In 1992, interest was further stimulated by Rykodisc's reissues of the band's albums, complemented by a collection of Bell's solo work.[4]:13\n

Scoppa finds that in each mode, "the guitar sound is sharp-edged and full".[13] #1 Record was released in June 1972,[14]:115 and quickly received strong reviews. Billboard went as far as to say, "Every cut could be a single". Rolling Stone judged the album "exceptionally good", while Cashbox stated, "This album is one of those red-letter days when everything falls together as a total sound", and called it "an important record that should go to the top with proper handling".[5]:107  It was voted number 188 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).[15]\n

But Columbia had no interest in dealing with the independent distributors previously used by Stax and removed even the existing copies of #1 Record from the stores.[17]\n

Being a three-piece really opened things up for me in terms of playing drums. Drums take on a different role in a three-piece band, so it was a lot of fun. [...] Radio City was really more spontaneous, and the performances were pretty close to live performances."[5]:126–130\n

Radio City, Barnes finds, has "plenty of shimmering pop delights", although "the opening tune, 'O My Soul,' is a foreboding, sprawling funk affair"; Barnes concludes that "Sometimes they sound like the Byrds, sometimes like the early Who, but usually like their own indescribable selves".[13]\n

Record reported, "The sound is stimulating, the musicianship superb, and the result is tight and rollickingly rhythmic."[5]:140 Billboard judged it "a highly commercial set".[5]:140 Rolling Stone's Bud Scoppa, then with Phonograph Record, affirmed, "Alex Chilton has now emerged as a major talent, and he'll be heard from again".[5]:140 Cashbox called it "a collection of excellent material that hopefully will break this deserving band in a big way".[5]:140 But just as #1 Record had fallen victim to poor marketing, so too did Radio City. Columbia, now in complete control of the Stax catalog, refused to process it following a disagreement. Without a distributor, sales of Radio City, though far greater than those of #1 Record, were minimal at only around 20,000 copies.[5]:140\n

What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill."[22]\n

Little did I know we'd be playing that set for the next ten years".[5]:253–260 The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival.[5]:253 A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University.[5]:253–260 The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan,[5]:253–260 as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.[1]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                              William John secondnameplaceholder (August 16, 1929 – September 15, 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly played in trios.[2] His use of impressionist harmony, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continues to influence jazz pianists today.\n
 Born in Plainfield, New Jersey, in 1929, he was classically trained at Southeastern Louisiana University and the Mannes School of Music, in New York City, where he majored in composition and received the Artist Diploma. In 1955, he moved to New York City, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell. In 1958, secondnameplaceholder joined Miles Davis's sextet, which in 1959, then immersed in modal jazz, recorded Kind of Blue, the best-selling jazz album of all time.[3] During that time, secondnameplaceholder was also playing with Chet Baker for the album Chet.\n

In 1961, ten days after finishing an engagement at the New York Village Vanguard jazz club, LaFaro died in a car accident. After months of seclusion, secondnameplaceholder reemerged with a new trio, featuring bassist Chuck Israels.\n

Nicknamed "Lady Day" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, secondnameplaceholder had an innovative influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.[1]\n
 After a turbulent childhood, secondnameplaceholder began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was heard by producer John Hammond, who liked her voice. She signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Collaborations with Teddy Wilson produced the hit "What a Little Moonlight Can Do", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, secondnameplaceholder had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall.\nShe was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Because of personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, Lady in Satin, was released in 1958. secondnameplaceholder died of cirrhosis on July 17, 1959 at age 44. She won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Several films about her life have been released.\n

 AllMusic journalist Bruce Eder stated that secondnameplaceholder's "mix of rough-hewn good looks and unassuming masculinity, coupled with an underlying vulnerability, all presented with a good voice and some serious musical talent, helped turn [him] into a major rock and roll star in short order".[5] Others have suggested that his rapid rise to prominence was due to his "Elvis-influenced hip swivelling and, at times, highly suggestive stage act".[6]\n William Everett secondnameplaceholder (September 2, 1946 – June 6, 2006)[2] was an American musician, whose work encompassed R&B, rock, soul, funk, and gospel. secondnameplaceholder was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as Little Richard, Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, Everly Brothers, Reverend James Cleveland,[3] The Rolling Stones, and the Beatles.

Rey Soul.[5] Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently refashioned themselves as a more marketable pop-rap act.[4] Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album, Elephunk, in 2003, that they achieved high record sales. \n
 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' first major hit was the 2003 single "Where Is the Love?" from Elephunk, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2003. Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, and became certified 3× Platinum in the United States. In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the number-one and number-two spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta Feeling", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks.\n
                                                The album The E.N.D. produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with "Imma Be", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with "Rock That Body" and "Meet Me Halfway", which peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100. "I Gotta Feeling" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom.[6] At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show.\n

They reunited in 2011 and released their final studio album and nineteenth overall, 13 (2013), which features all of the original members except Ward. During their farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017.[2][3]\n

They were eagerly anticipated by the music press following on the success of each of the member's former bands, including Clapton and Baker's former group Cream and Winwood's former group Traffic, but they split after only a few months, producing only one album and a three-month long summer tour.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The group originated with informal jamming by Clapton and Winwood in early 1969 following the break-ups of Cream and Traffic. Baker joined them in rehearsals and they decided to form a group. Grech joined as the fourth member from the band Family in May, and they began recording their eponymous debut album. It drew controversy for featuring a photograph of a topless 11-year-old girl on the front cover, and it was issued with a different cover in the United States.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The first firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder concert was on 7 June in front of an estimated 100,000 fans in Hyde Park, London, but they felt that they had not rehearsed enough and were unprepared. They subsequently played concerts in Scandinavia and the US, but the lack of material in the live set led them to play old Cream and Traffic songs which pleased the audience but disillusioned the band. Clapton became increasingly isolated during the tour, preferring to spend time with support act Delaney & Bonnie, and the band split up immediately after their last performance. Clapton and Winwood both enjoyed the music that they played together in the group's limited time, and they have since collaborated on several tours playing firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder material.\n
 Because Winwood was signed to Island Records, he had to obtain permission from Blackwell (who owned the label) to appear on Polydor Records (to whom Clapton and Baker were signed in the U.K.).[10] A promotional single was released by Island, although the promotion was for the label itself. It was a single announcing the fact that they were moving their offices, titled "Change Of Address From 23 June 1969". This one-sided promo featured an instrumental jam by firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, who were not mentioned on the label (the only other label info is the new address, phone number, and new cable address of Island).[11] Recorded at Olympic Studios during session for the debut album, an estimated 500 copies of the single were pressed, and mostly sent to UK disc jockeys and other music industry insiders. The track was finally released widely when it appeared as a bonus track on the two-CD "Deluxe Edition" of the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder album in 2000 (titled "Change Of Address Jam").[12]\n

It provoked controversy because it featured a topless 11-year-old girl, holding in her hands a silver space ship. The US record company issued it with an alternative cover with a photograph of the band on the front. The model on the cover posed upon consent by her parents and was paid £40 (£663 as of 2019) for the shot.[15][17]\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          News of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's formation created a buzz of excitement among the public and press. The group debuted at a free concert at London's Hyde Park on 7 June 1969 in front of 100,000 fans.[19] Capaldi and Wood attended the gig, as did Mick Jagger and Marianne secondnameplaceholderfull.[3] The setlist contained all six numbers that would appear on the debut album, along with a cover of The Rolling Stones' "Under My Thumb", Traffic's "Means to an End", and Sam Myers' "Sleeping in the Ground".[20] The performance was well received by fans, but troubled Clapton, who thought that the band's playing was sub-par.[21] He spent much of the gig close to his amplifiers and not coming forward on stage; only Baker supplied any showmanship and theatrics during the set.[19]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Though the group were still developing, their management insisted they continue touring to provide income.[17] Clapton, knowing the band had not rehearsed enough and was unprepared, was reluctant to tour, but agreed to do so because he could collaborate with Winwood and had no better work offers.[7] The recording of their album continued, followed by a short tour of Scandinavia, where the band played smaller gigs and was able to rehearse their sound and prepare it for bigger audiences in the US and UK. After Scandinavia, the band toured the United States, making their debut at Madison Square Garden on 12 July.[17]\n
                                                                                                                                              A major problem with the tour was that the band had only a few songs in their catalogue, barely enough to fill an hour, which the audience did not know well.[22] Clapton in particular was against any lengthy jamming, which had been Cream's trademark, which would have allowed them to stretch out a set to a sufficient length.[23] The group were forced to play old Cream and Traffic songs, to the delight of a crowd which usually preferred the old hits to the new firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder material. Clapton resented being in a popular supergroup when he had intended to start a more low-key project. They were playing the same material from his Cream days, to appease the audience and to fill the void left by the lack of adequate new material.[17] Clapton wanted to play the Woodstock Festival, which occurred during the tour, but was outvoted by the rest of the group.[24]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The tour was supported by opening acts Free, Taste, and R&B-based rock act Delaney & Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending most of his time with them instead of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder,[17] letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band.[23] Clapton even began sitting in on Delaney & Bonnie's opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. He also wanted them to be the headliners instead of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[25]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The band toured for seven more weeks in the US, finishing in Hawaii on 24 August.[26][3] After the gig, Clapton and Winwood decided to end the group. Grech was immediately informed, but Baker did not find out until he had returned to England following a short holiday in Jamaica. When he finally got home to the UK, he met with Winwood and was upset to find that the band had split up.[26]\n

He stepped out of the spotlight, first to sit in with the Plastic Ono Band,[29] and then to tour as a sideman for Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. This freed him of the limelight that he had considered a plague to both Cream and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[26] After his sideman stint, he took several members from Delaney & Bonnie to form a new super-group, Derek and the Dominos.[30] He never dropped his firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder repertoire completely, as "Presence of the Lord" and "Can't Find My Way Home" have been performed occasionally throughout his solo career.[15][31]\n

The shows were a benefit for former Small Faces and Faces member Ronnie Lane, who was suffering from the syndrome.[37]\n

That performance inspired the two to perform three reunion concerts at Madison Square Garden that took place on 25, 26 and 28 February 2008. It was not an official firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder reunion, but simply "Winwood and Clapton". They performed the four songs on the first side of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder as well as selections from Traffic, Derek and the Dominos, Clapton's solo career and some covers.[38] A DVD and a two-disc CD of these performances was released in 2009.[39]\n

During rehearsals, secondnameplaceholder had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship, secondnameplaceholder refused to appear.[69]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       By this time, secondnameplaceholder and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.[70] secondnameplaceholder's third album, The Times They Are a-Changin', reflected a more politicized secondnameplaceholder.[71] The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with "Only a Pawn in Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker Medgar Evers; and the Brechtian "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.[72] On a more general theme, "Ballad of Hollis Brown" and "North Country Blues" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings".[73]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    By the end of 1963, secondnameplaceholder felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.[74] Accepting the "Tom Paine Award" from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated secondnameplaceholder questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.[75]\n
 In July 1965, secondnameplaceholder's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" peaked at number two in the U.S. chart. In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time".[5][100] Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for secondnameplaceholder's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind."[101] The song opened secondnameplaceholder's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from secondnameplaceholder's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.[102] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. "Desolation Row", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass,[103] offers the sole exception, with secondnameplaceholder alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse".[104]\n

Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range."[133] During one recording session, secondnameplaceholder and Cash recorded a series of duets but only their version of secondnameplaceholder's "Girl from the North Country" was released on the album.[134][135]\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In the early 1970s, critics charged that secondnameplaceholder's output was varied and unpredictable. Rolling Stone writer Greil Marcus asked "What is this shit?" on first listening to Self Portrait, released in June 1970.[138][139] It was a double LP including few original songs, and was poorly received.[140] In October 1970, secondnameplaceholder released New Morning, considered a return to form.[141] This album included "Day of the Locusts", a song in which secondnameplaceholder gave an account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970.[142] In November 1968, secondnameplaceholder had co-written "I'd Have You Anytime" with George Harrison;[143] Harrison recorded "I'd Have You Anytime" and secondnameplaceholder's "If Not for You" for his 1970 solo triple album All Things Must Pass. secondnameplaceholder's surprise appearance at Harrison's 1971 Concert for Bangladesh attracted media coverage, reflecting that secondnameplaceholder's live appearances had become rare.[144]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Between March 16 and 19, 1971, secondnameplaceholder reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village, to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in "Watching the River Flow" and a new recording of "When I Paint My Masterpiece".[145] On November 4, 1971, secondnameplaceholder recorded "George Jackson", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison that year.[146] secondnameplaceholder contributed piano and harmony to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas (referencing Under Milk Wood by secondnameplaceholder Thomas and his own previous name) in September 1972.[147]\n

In the NME, Nick Kent described the "accompaniments" as "often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes".[163] In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness."[163] Over the years critics came to see it as one of secondnameplaceholder's greatest achievements. For the Salon website, journalist Bill Wyman wrote: "Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years".[164] Novelist Rick Moody called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape".[165]\n

Slow Train Coming (1979) featured the guitar accompaniment of Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) and was produced by veteran R&B producer Jerry Wexler. Wexler said that secondnameplaceholder had tried to evangelize him during the recording. He replied: "firstnameplaceholder, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist. Let's just make an album."[189] secondnameplaceholder won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song "Gotta Serve Somebody". His second Christian-themed album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as "the nearest thing to a follow-up album secondnameplaceholder has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior".[190] His third overtly Christian album was Shot of Love in 1981.[191] When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, secondnameplaceholder would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:\n

Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] secondnameplaceholder's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a decade.[4][5] Over the course of his career secondnameplaceholder became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality.[6] He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for the legalization of marijuana, while he also advocated for Pan-Africanism.[7]\n
 Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, secondnameplaceholder began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single "One Love/People Get Ready"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[8] The Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with the singer's conversion to Rastafari. During this period secondnameplaceholder relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).[9]\n
                                                                                    The group attained international success after the release of the albums Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring artists. Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, secondnameplaceholder went on to release his solo material under the band's name.[10] His debut studio album Natty Dread (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up Rastaman Vibration (1976). A few months after the album's release secondnameplaceholder survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to permanently relocate to London. During his time in London he recorded the album Exodus (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock and enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success.\n

From the 1970s onwards, secondnameplaceholder's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009[4] and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, secondnameplaceholder writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation.[5] In 2019, secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.[6]\n

He became involved with the Scratch Orchestra and the Portsmouth Sinfonia; secondnameplaceholder's first appearance on a commercially released recording is the Deutsche Grammophon edition of The Great Learning (1971) by Cornelius Cardew and the Scratch Orchestra which features secondnameplaceholder as one of the voices on the track "Paragraph 7".[21] Another early recording was the soundtrack to Berlin Horse (1970), a nine-minute avant-garde art film by Malcolm Le Grice.[22][23] At one point, secondnameplaceholder had to earn money as paste-up assistant for the advertisement section of a local paper for three months. He quit and became an electronics dealer by buying old speakers and making new cabinets for them before selling them to friends.[12]\n
 In 1971, secondnameplaceholder co-formed the glam and art rock band Roxy Music. He had a chance meeting with saxophonist Andy Mackay at a train station, which led to him joining the band. secondnameplaceholder later said: "If I'd walked ten yards further on the platform, or missed that train, or been in the next carriage, I probably would have been an art teacher now".[24] secondnameplaceholder played on their first two albums, Roxy Music (1972) and For Your Pleasure (1973), and is credited as "secondnameplaceholder" with playing the VCS 3 synthesiser, tape effects, backing vocals, and co-producer. Initially secondnameplaceholder did not appear on stage at their live shows, but operated the group's mixing desk at the centre of the concert venue where he had a microphone to sing backup vocals. After the group secured a record deal, secondnameplaceholder joined them on stage performing the synthesiser[12] and became known for his flamboyant costumes and makeup. After touring For Your Pleasure ended in mid-1973, secondnameplaceholder quit the band. He cited disagreements with lead singer Bryan Ferry and the frontman's insistence on being in command of the group, which affected secondnameplaceholder's ability to incorporate his own ideas.[25]\n

The first album with secondnameplaceholder credited as producer was Lucky Leif and the Longships by Robert Calvert. secondnameplaceholder's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for Talking Heads, U2, Devo, Ultravox and James. He also produced part of the 1993 album When I Was a Boy by Jane Siberry. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 BRIT Awards.\n

His skill at using "The Studio as a Compositional Tool"[64] (the title of an essay by secondnameplaceholder) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on Genesis's The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, he is credited with 'secondnameplaceholderssification'; on Robert Wyatt's Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard with a Direct inject anti-jazz raygun and on John Cale's Island albums as simply being "secondnameplaceholder".\n

In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the "Prophecy Theme" for the David Lynch film Dune; the rest of the soundtrack was composed and performed by the group Toto. secondnameplaceholder produced performance artist Laurie Anderson's Bright Red album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. secondnameplaceholder played on David Byrne's musical score for The Catherine Wheel, a project commissioned by Twyla Tharp to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.\n

Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on Low were largely created by secondnameplaceholder, who played a portable EMS Synthi A synthesizer. Producer Tony Visconti used an Eventide Harmonizer to alter the sound of the drums, claiming that the audio processor "f–s with the fabric of time."[65] After Bowie died in early 2016, secondnameplaceholder said that he and Bowie had been talking about taking Outside, the last album they'd worked on together, "somewhere new", and expressed regret that they wouldn't be able to pursue the project.[66]\n

In 1995, U2 and secondnameplaceholder joined forces to create the album Original Soundtracks 1 under the group name Passengers; songs from which included "Your Blue Room" and "Miss Sarajevo".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. secondnameplaceholder also produced Laid (1993), Wah Wah (1994) Millionaires (1999) and Pleased to Meet You (2001) for James, performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for "frequent interference and occasional co-production" on their 1997 album Whiplash.\n

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. secondnameplaceholder describes the first video camera he received, which would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n

I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic."[70]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Panasonic industrial camera secondnameplaceholder received had significant design flaws preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.[71] The pieces secondnameplaceholder produced with this method, such as Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan (1980) and Thursday Afternoon (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.'

I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast."[72]\n

He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: "I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like Terry Riley, and when I first started playing with tape recorders."\n[75]\n

I like blurring those distinctions – I like to work with all the complex sounds on the way out to the horizon, to pure noise, like the hum of London."[79] With each installation secondnameplaceholder's music and artworks interrogate the visitors' perception of space and time within a seductive, immersive environment.[80][81]\n

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: "In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, secondnameplaceholder explored the notion of environmental ambiance. secondnameplaceholder proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented "Muzak" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. secondnameplaceholder echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman."[86]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Early installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired secondnameplaceholder to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. "2 Fifth Avenue", ("a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports") resulted from secondnameplaceholder shooting "the view from his apartment window: without ... intervention," recording "what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time ... In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas. ... secondnameplaceholder manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'"[87]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    From the outset, secondnameplaceholder's video works, were "more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema".[88] The author and artist John Coulthart called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan (1980–81), which incorporated music from Ambient 4: On Land, "The first ambient film." He explains: "secondnameplaceholder filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980–81. The low-grade equipment ... give[s] the images a hazy, impressionistic quality. Lack of a tripod meant filming with the camera lying on its side so the tape had to be re-viewed with a television monitor also turned on its side."[89] And turning the TV on its side, says David A. Ross, "recontextualize[d] the television set, and ... subliminally shift[ed] the way the video image represents recognizable realities ... Natural phenomena like rain look quite different in this orientation; less familiar but curiously more real."[90]\n

TV was actually the most controllable light source that had ever been invented – because you could precisely specify the movement and behaviour of several million points of coloured light on a surface. The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range."[91]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Turning the TV on its back, secondnameplaceholder played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. "The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence."[92]\n

Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.[93]\n

For the I Dormienti show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by Mimmo Paladino in the middle of the circular room, secondnameplaceholder placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n

Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, "sculptural objects [that] ... consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit."[94] The first version of these were shown at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam(1984).\n

He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.[95]\n

These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as "tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks". secondnameplaceholder used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.[97]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The continually flowing non-repeating music and art of secondnameplaceholder's installations mitigate against habituation to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. "One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less "dramatic" and more sensual."[98] Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. "Compact Forest Proposal" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: "During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space."[99]\n

The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.[100] The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n

With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, secondnameplaceholder created a generative art/music installation 77 Million Paintings for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. "One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined…" [101]\n

Some of the slides had formed his earlier Natural Selections exhibition projected onto the windows of the Triennale in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of secondnameplaceholder's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.[102]\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           With the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. secondnameplaceholder likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.[106] In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: "Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. …The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows."[101]\n

It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the Sydney Opera House (2009), Carioca Aqueduct (the Arcos di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.[107] Turner asked secondnameplaceholder to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and secondnameplaceholder's latest "Light Boxes" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.[108]\n

They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst secondnameplaceholder's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named "Quiet Room for Montefiore" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings secondnameplaceholder's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n

Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n

They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad:\n

Unlike other Apps they released Reflection provides no real options other than Play/Pause – later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   secondnameplaceholder's "light boxes" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in Kite Stories (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer "is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself". He likens secondnameplaceholder's art to "Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding."[115]\n

They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, secondnameplaceholder's light paintings have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n

The first group of three releases included his own composition, Discreet Music, and the now-famous The Sinking of the Titanic (1969) and Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet (1971) by Gavin Bryars. The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of German baroque componist Johann Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which secondnameplaceholder had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a tape loop system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Robert Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                firstnameplaceholder Frederick Joseph secondnameplaceholder (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who is both a solo artist and the leader of the E Street Band. Originally from the Jersey Shore, he received critical acclaim for his early 1970s albums and attained worldwide fame upon the release of Born to Run in 1975. During a career that has spanned five decades, secondnameplaceholder has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length.[1] He has been nicknamed "The Boss".[2] He has recorded both rock albums and folk-oriented works, and his lyrics often address the experiences and struggles of working-class Americans.\n
 Born in the U.S.A. (1984) is secondnameplaceholder's most commercially successful album, making him one of the most successful rock figures of the 1980s. It was certified 15× platinum in the US and has sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Seven of its singles reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 including the title track, which was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans — some of whom were secondnameplaceholder's friends. Advocating for the rights of the common working-class man, the song made a huge political impact.[3] secondnameplaceholder's other best-known songs include "Born to Run" (1975), "Thunder Road" (1975), "Badlands" (1978), "Hungry Heart" (1980), "The River" (1980), "Atlantic City" (1982), "Dancing in the Dark" (1984), "I'm on Fire" (1984), "Glory Days" (1984), "Brilliant Disguise" (1987), "Human Touch" (1992), "Streets of Philadelphia" (1994), and "The Rising" (2002).\n

Van Vliet made few public appearances after his retirement from music in 1982. He pursued a career in art, an interest that originated in his childhood talent for sculpture, and a venture which proved to be his most financially secure. His expressionist paintings and drawings command high prices, and have been exhibited in art galleries and museums across the world.[5][12][13] Van Vliet died in 2010, having suffered from multiple sclerosis for many years.[14]\n

The song "Electricity" was a poem written by Bermann, who gave Van Vliet permission to adapt it to music.[39]  Unlike the album's mostly blues rock sound, songs such as "Electricity" illustrated the band's unconventional instrumentation and Van Vliet's unusual vocals, which guitarist Doug Moon described as "hinting of things to come".[This quote needs a citation]\n

The band began recording in spring 1967, with Richard Perry cutting his teeth in his first job as producer. The album was released in September 1967. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic called the album "blues–rock gone slightly askew, with jagged, fractured rhythms, soulful, twisting vocals from Van Vliet, and more doo wop, soul, straight blues, and folk–rock influences than he would employ on his more avant garde outings".\n
                                                      Among those who took notice were the Beatles. Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were known as great admirers of secondnameplaceholder.[40] Lennon displayed two of the album's promotional "baby bumper stickers" in the sunroom at his home.[41] Later, the Beatles planned to sign secondnameplaceholder to their experimental Zapple label (plans that were scrapped after Allen Klein took over the group's management). Van Vliet was often critical of the Beatles, however. He considered the lyric "I'd love to turn you on" from their song A Day in the Life, to be ridiculous and conceited. Tiring of their "lullabies",[42] he lampooned them with the Strictly Personal song Beatle Bones 'n' Smokin' Stones, that featured the sardonic refrain of "strawberry fields, all the winged eels slither on the heels of today's children, strawberry fields forever". Vliet spoke badly of Lennon after getting no response when he sent a telegram of support to him and wife Yoko Ono during their 1969 "Bed-In for peace". Vliet and the band met McCartney in a Cannes hotel nightclub during their tour of Europe on January 27, 1968, urinated together on a statue outside the hotel at the prodding of journalists and photographers,[citation needed] and participated in a jam session together with McCartney and Penny Nichols. Producer attempts to convince McCartney to switch labels to Kama Sutra obstructed the possibility of a pleasant evening.[43] McCartney later said he had no recollection of this meeting.[44]\n

Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that he walked into the room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, "Get that fucking thing out of here, get out of here and get back in your room", which he did.[27] (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have "passed through" the studio with a weapon.)[45] Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker.[46] Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would have a profound effect on the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.\n
 To support the album's release the group had been scheduled to play at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. During this period Vliet suffered severe anxiety attacks that made him convinced that he was having a heart attack, possibly exacerbated by his heavy LSD use and the fact that his father had died of heart failure a few years earlier. At a vital "warm-up" performance at the Mt. Tamalpais Festival (June 10–11) shortly before the scheduled Monterey Festival (June 16–18), the band began to play "Electricity" and Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the 10 ft (3.0 m) stage and landed on manager Bob Krasnow. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth.[47] This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet,[27] effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. With such complex guitar parts there was no means for the band to find a competent replacement in time for Monterey. Cooder's spot was eventually filled for a short spell by Gerry McGee, who had played with the Monkees. According to French the band did two gigs with McGee, one of which was at The Peppermint Twist near Long Beach. The other was at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, August 7, 1967, as opening act for the Yardbirds.[48] McGee was in the group long enough to have an outfit made by a Santa Monica boutique[48] that also created the gear worn by the band on the Strictly Personal cover stamps.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                           In August 1967, guitarist Jeff Cotton filled the guitar spot vacated, in turn, by Cooder and McGee. In October and November 1967 the Snouffer/Cotton/Handley/French line–up recorded material for what was planned to be the second album. Originally intended to be a double album called It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper for the Buddah label, it was released later in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Bob Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of "Mirror Man" and "Kandy Korn". Krasnow created a strange mix full of "phasing" that, by most accounts (including secondnameplaceholder's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as Strictly Personal on Krasnow's Blue Thumb label.[50] Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a "terrific album" and a "fascinating, underrated release ... every bit the equal of Safe as Milk and Trout Mask Replica".[49] Langdon Winner of Rolling Stone called Strictly Personal "an excellent album. The guitars of the Magic Band mercilessly bend and stretch notes in a way that suggests that the world of music has wobbled clear off its axis", with the lyrics demonstrating "secondnameplaceholder's ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights".[51]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In 1971 some of the recordings done for Buddah were released as Mirror Man, bearing a liner note stating that the material had been recorded in "one night in Los Angeles in 1965". This was a ruse to circumvent possible copyright issues. The material was recorded in November and December 1967. Essentially a "jam" album, described as pushing "the boundaries of conventional blues–rock, with a secondnameplaceholder vocal tossed in here and there. Some may miss secondnameplaceholder's surreal poetry, gruff vocals, and/or free jazz influence, while others may find it fascinating to hear the Magic Band simply letting go and cutting loose."[52] The album's "miss-credit errors" also state band members as "Alex St. Clare Snouffer" (Alex St. Clare/Alexis Snouffer), "Antennae Jimmy Simmons" (Semens/Jeff Cotton) and "Jerry Handsley" (Handley). First vinyl was issued in both a die-cut gatefold (revealing a "cracked" mirror) and a single sleeve with same image. The UK Buddah issue was part of the Polydor-manufactured "Select" series.\n
                                         During his first trip to England in January 1968, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was briefly represented in the UK by mod icon Peter Meaden, an early manager of the Who. The firstnameplaceholder and his band members were initially denied entry to the United Kingdom, because Meaden had illegally booked them for gigs without applying for appropriate work permits.[53] After returning to Germany for a few days, press coverage and public outcry resulted in the band being permitted to re-enter the UK, where they recorded material for John Peel's radio show and on Friday January 19 appeared at the Middle Earth venue, introduced by Peel, where they played tracks from Safe as Milk and some of the experimental blues tracks from Mirror Man. The band was met by an enthusiastic audience; French recalled the event as a rare high moment for the band: "After the show, we were taken to the dressing room where we sat for hours as a line of what seemed like hundreds of people walked in one by one to shake our hand or get an autograph. Many brought imports of Safe as Milk with them for us to autograph ... It seemed like we had finally gained some reward ... Suddenly all the criticizing and intimidation and eccentricities seemed very unimportant. It was a glorious moment, one of the very few I ever experienced".[54] By this time, they had terminated their association with Meaden. On January 27, 1968, secondnameplaceholder performed in the MIDEM Music Festival on the beach at Cannes, France.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 After their Euro tour and the Cannes beach performance the band returned to the US. Moves were already in the air for them to leave Buddah and sign to MGM and, prior to their May tour – mainly in the UK – they re-recorded some Buddah material of the partial Mirror Man sessions at Sunset Sound with Bruce Botnick. secondnameplaceholder had also been conceptualizing new band names, including 25th Century Quaker and Blue Thumb,[55] while making suggestions to other musicians that they might get involved. The thought-process of 25th Century Quaker was that it would be a "blues band" alias for the more avant-garde work of the Magic Band. Photographer Guy Webster actually photographed the band in Quaker-style outfits, and the picture appears in The Mirror Man Sessions CD insert. It would later transpire that much of this situation was transient and that Buddah's Bob Krasnow was to set up his own label. The label that was unsurprisingly named Blue Thumb launched with its first release Strictly Personal, a truncated version of the original secondnameplaceholder vision of a double album. Thus "25th Century Quaker" became a track and a potential band-name became a label.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In overview, the works for the double album in this period were intended to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a "strictly personal" over-stamp and addressed in a manner that could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; as per the small ads of the time: "It comes to you in a plain brown wrapper." Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. Strictly Personal was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain't Weird and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as It Comes To You in a Plain Brown Wrapper (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both Blue Thumb and the stamps on the cover of Strictly Personal have LSD connotations, as does the track Ah Feel Like Ahcid, although secondnameplaceholder himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of "I feel like I said").\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Critically acclaimed as Van Vliet's magnum opus,[56] Trout Mask Replica was released as a 28 track double album in June 1969 on Frank Zappa's newly formed Straight Records label. First issues, in the US, were auto-coupled and housed in the black "Straight" liners along with a 6-page lyric sheet illustrated by the Mascara Snake. A school-age portrait of Van Vliet appears on the front of this sheet, while the cover of the gatefold enigmatically shows secondnameplaceholder in a 'Quaker' hat, obscuring his face with the head of a fish. The fish is a carp – arguably a "replica" for a trout, photographed by Cal Schenkel. The inner spread "infra-red" photography is by Ed Caraeff, whose secondnameplaceholder vacuum cleaner images from this session also appear on Zappa's Hot Rats release (a month earlier) to accompany "Willie The Pimp" lyrics sung by Vliet. Alex St. Clair had now left the band and, after Junior Madeo from the Blackouts was considered,[57] the role was filled by Bill Harkleroad. Bassist Jerry Handley had also departed, with Gary Marker stepping in. Thus the long rehearsals for the album began in the house on Ensenada Drive in Woodland Hills, L.A.,[58][59] that would become the Magic Band House.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Magic Band began recordings for Trout Mask Replica with bassist Gary "Magic" Marker at T.T.G. (on "Moonlight on Vermont" and "Veteran's Day Poppy"),[60] but later enlisted bassist Mark Boston after his departure. The remainder of the album was recorded at Whitney Studios, with some field recordings made at the house.[58] Boston was acquainted with French and Harkleroad via past bands. Van Vliet had also begun assigning nicknames to his band members, so Harkleroad became Zoot Horn Rollo, and Boston became Rockette Morton, while John French assumed the name Drumbo, and Jeff Cotton became Antennae Jimmy Semens. Van Vliet's cousin Victor Hayden, the Mascara Snake, performed as a bass clarinetist later in the proceedings.[61] Vliet's girlfriend Laurie Stone, who can be heard laughing at the beginning of Fallin' Ditch, became an audio typist[62] at the Magic Band house.\n
                                      Van Vliet wanted the whole band to "live" the Trout Mask Replica album. The group rehearsed Van Vliet's difficult compositions for eight months, living communally in their small rented house in the Woodland Hills suburb of Los Angeles. With only two bedrooms the band members would find sleep in various corners of one, while Vliet occupied the other and rehearsals were accomplished in the main living area. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. At various times one or another of the group members was "put in the barrel", with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission.[63] Guitarist Bill Harkleroad complained that his fingers were a "bloody mess" as a result of secondnameplaceholder's orders that he use heavy strings.[64] Drummer John French described the situation as "cultlike"[65] and a visiting friend said "the environment in that house was positively Mansonesque".[5] Their material circumstances were dire. With no income other than welfare and contributions from relatives, the group barely survived and were even arrested for shoplifting food (Zappa bailed them out).[66] French has recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month.[27] A visitor described their appearance as "cadaverous" and said that "they all looked in poor health". Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for 14 or more hours a day.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       John French's 2010 book Through the Eyes of Magic describes some of the "talks", which were initiated by his doing such things as playing a Frank Zappa drum part ("The Blimp (mousetrapreplica)") in his drumming shed, and not having finished drum parts as quickly as secondnameplaceholder wanted. French writes of being punched by band members, thrown into walls, kicked, punched in the face by secondnameplaceholder hard enough to draw blood, being attacked with a sharp broomstick.[67] Eventually secondnameplaceholder, French says, threatened to throw him out an upper floor window. He admits complicity in similarly attacking his bandmates during "talks" aimed at them. In the end, after the album's recording, secondnameplaceholder ejected French from the band by throwing him down a set of stairs, telling him to "Take a walk, man" after not responding in a desired manner to a request to "play a strawberry" on the drums. secondnameplaceholder replaced French with drummer Jeff Bruschel, an acquaintance of Hayden. Referred to as "Fake Drumbo" (playing on French's drumset) this final act resulted in French's name not appearing on the album credits, either as a player or arranger. Bruschel toured with the band to Europe but was replaced by the next recording.\n

(The band did watch Federico Fellini's 1963 film 8½ during the creation of the album). It took the band about eight months to mold the songs into shape, with French bearing primary responsibility for transposing and shaping Vliet's piano fragments into guitar and bass lines, which were mostly notated on paper.[69] Harkleroad in 1998 said in retrospect: "We're dealing with a strange person, coming from a place of being a sculptor/painter, using music as his idiom. He was getting more into that part of who he was instead of this blues singer."[68] The band had rehearsed the songs so thoroughly that the instrumental tracks for 21 of the songs were recorded in a single four and a half hour recording session.[69] Van Vliet spent the next few days overdubbing the vocals. The album's cover artwork was photographed and designed by Cal Schenkel and shows Van Vliet wearing the raw head of a carp, bought from a local fish market and fashioned into a mask by Schenkel.[70]\n

The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an iconoclastic whole of contrapuntal tempos, featuring slide guitar, polyrhythmic drumming (with French's drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and bass clarinet. Van Vliet's vocals range from his signature Howlin' Wolf-inspired growl to frenzied falsetto to laconic, casual ramblings.\n

It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not."[27]\n

Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band.[71] Last, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.[15]\n

However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era."[72] In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by Rolling Stone in their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: "On first listen, Trout Mask Replica sounds like raw Delta blues", with secondnameplaceholder "singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day for months on end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.) Tracks such as 'Ella Guru' and 'My Human Gets Me Blues' are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as Tom Waits and PJ Harvey."[11] Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process "forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable".[73]\n

But I'd like to. Very great played at high volume when you're feeling shitty, because you'll never feel as shitty as this record."[74] BBC disc jockey John Peel said of the album: "If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then Trout Mask Replica is probably that work."[75] It was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry in 2011.\n

An album with "a very coherent structure"[attribution needed] in the Magic Band's "most experimental and visionary stage",[attribution needed][76] it was Van Vliet's most commercially successful in the United Kingdom, spending twenty weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 20. An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop, silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and secondnameplaceholder kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several programs related to music.[77][78]\n

Lick My Decals Off, Baby was the first record on which the band was credited as "The" Magic Band, rather than "His" Magic Band. Journalist Irwin Chusid interprets this change as "a grudging concession of its members' at least semiautonomous humanity".[71] Robert Christgau gave the album an A−, commenting, "secondnameplaceholder's famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny."[74] Due to licensing disputes, Lick My Decals Off, Baby was unavailable on CD for many years, though it remained in print on vinyl. It was ranked second in Uncut magazine's May 2010 list of The 50 Greatest Lost Albums.[79] In 2011, the album became available for download on the iTunes Store.[80]\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                           In August 1967, guitarist Jeff Cotton filled the guitar spot vacated, in turn, by Cooder and McGee. In October and November 1967 the Snouffer/Cotton/Handley/French line–up recorded material for what was planned to be the second album. Originally intended to be a double album called It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper for the Buddah label, it was released later in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Bob Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of "Mirror Man" and "Kandy Korn". Krasnow created a strange mix full of "phasing" that, by most accounts (including secondnameplaceholder's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as Strictly Personal on Krasnow's Blue Thumb label.[50] Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a "terrific album" and a "fascinating, underrated release ... every bit the equal of Safe as Milk and Trout Mask Replica".[49] Langdon Winner of Rolling Stone called Strictly Personal "an excellent album. The guitars of the Magic Band mercilessly bend and stretch notes in a way that suggests that the world of music has wobbled clear off its axis", with the lyrics demonstrating "secondnameplaceholder's ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights".[51]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In 1971 some of the recordings done for Buddah were released as Mirror Man, bearing a liner note stating that the material had been recorded in "one night in Los Angeles in 1965". This was a ruse to circumvent possible copyright issues. The material was recorded in November and December 1967. Essentially a "jam" album, described as pushing "the boundaries of conventional blues–rock, with a secondnameplaceholder vocal tossed in here and there. Some may miss secondnameplaceholder's surreal poetry, gruff vocals, and/or free jazz influence, while others may find it fascinating to hear the Magic Band simply letting go and cutting loose."[52] The album's "miss-credit errors" also state band members as "Alex St. Clare Snouffer" (Alex St. Clare/Alexis Snouffer), "Antennae Jimmy Simmons" (Semens/Jeff Cotton) and "Jerry Handsley" (Handley). First vinyl was issued in both a die-cut gatefold (revealing a "cracked" mirror) and a single sleeve with same image. The UK Buddah issue was part of the Polydor-manufactured "Select" series.\n
                                         During his first trip to England in January 1968, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was briefly represented in the UK by mod icon Peter Meaden, an early manager of the Who. The firstnameplaceholder and his band members were initially denied entry to the United Kingdom, because Meaden had illegally booked them for gigs without applying for appropriate work permits.[53] After returning to Germany for a few days, press coverage and public outcry resulted in the band being permitted to re-enter the UK, where they recorded material for John Peel's radio show and on Friday January 19 appeared at the Middle Earth venue, introduced by Peel, where they played tracks from Safe as Milk and some of the experimental blues tracks from Mirror Man. The band was met by an enthusiastic audience; French recalled the event as a rare high moment for the band: "After the show, we were taken to the dressing room where we sat for hours as a line of what seemed like hundreds of people walked in one by one to shake our hand or get an autograph. Many brought imports of Safe as Milk with them for us to autograph ... It seemed like we had finally gained some reward ... Suddenly all the criticizing and intimidation and eccentricities seemed very unimportant. It was a glorious moment, one of the very few I ever experienced".[54] By this time, they had terminated their association with Meaden. On January 27, 1968, secondnameplaceholder performed in the MIDEM Music Festival on the beach at Cannes, France.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 After their Euro tour and the Cannes beach performance the band returned to the US. Moves were already in the air for them to leave Buddah and sign to MGM and, prior to their May tour – mainly in the UK – they re-recorded some Buddah material of the partial Mirror Man sessions at Sunset Sound with Bruce Botnick. secondnameplaceholder had also been conceptualizing new band names, including 25th Century Quaker and Blue Thumb,[55] while making suggestions to other musicians that they might get involved. The thought-process of 25th Century Quaker was that it would be a "blues band" alias for the more avant-garde work of the Magic Band. Photographer Guy Webster actually photographed the band in Quaker-style outfits, and the picture appears in The Mirror Man Sessions CD insert. It would later transpire that much of this situation was transient and that Buddah's Bob Krasnow was to set up his own label. The label that was unsurprisingly named Blue Thumb launched with its first release Strictly Personal, a truncated version of the original secondnameplaceholder vision of a double album. Thus "25th Century Quaker" became a track and a potential band-name became a label.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In overview, the works for the double album in this period were intended to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a "strictly personal" over-stamp and addressed in a manner that could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; as per the small ads of the time: "It comes to you in a plain brown wrapper." Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. Strictly Personal was the result, contained in its enigmatically-addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain't Weird and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as It Comes To You in a Plain Brown Wrapper (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both Blue Thumb and the stamps on the cover of Strictly Personal have LSD connotations, as does the track Ah Feel Like Ahcid, although secondnameplaceholder himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of "I feel like I said").\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Critically acclaimed as Van Vliet's magnum opus,[56] Trout Mask Replica was released as a 28 track double album in June 1969 on Frank Zappa's newly formed Straight Records label. First issues, in the US, were auto-coupled and housed in the black "Straight" liners along with a 6-page lyric sheet illustrated by the Mascara Snake. A school-age portrait of Van Vliet appears on the front of this sheet, while the cover of the gatefold enigmatically shows secondnameplaceholder in a 'Quaker' hat, obscuring his face with the head of a fish. The fish is a carp – arguably a "replica" for a trout, photographed by Cal Schenkel. The inner spread "infra-red" photography is by Ed Caraeff, whose secondnameplaceholder vacuum cleaner images from this session also appear on Zappa's Hot Rats release (a month earlier) to accompany "Willie The Pimp" lyrics sung by Vliet. Alex St. Clair had now left the band and, after Junior Madeo from the Blackouts was considered,[57] the role was filled by Bill Harkleroad. Bassist Jerry Handley had also departed, with Gary Marker stepping in. Thus the long rehearsals for the album began in the house on Ensenada Drive in Woodland Hills, L.A.,[58][59] that would become the Magic Band House.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Magic Band began recordings for Trout Mask Replica with bassist Gary "Magic" Marker at T.T.G. (on "Moonlight on Vermont" and "Veteran's Day Poppy"),[60] but later enlisted bassist Mark Boston after his departure. The remainder of the album was recorded at Whitney Studios, with some field recordings made at the house.[58] Boston was acquainted with French and Harkleroad via past bands. Van Vliet had also begun assigning nicknames to his band members, so Harkleroad became Zoot Horn Rollo, and Boston became Rockette Morton, while John French assumed the name Drumbo, and Jeff Cotton became Antennae Jimmy Semens. Van Vliet's cousin Victor Hayden, the Mascara Snake, performed as a bass clarinetist later in the proceedings.[61] Vliet's girlfriend Laurie Stone, who can be heard laughing at the beginning of Fallin' Ditch, became an audio typist[62] at the Magic Band house.\n
                                      Van Vliet wanted the whole band to "live" the Trout Mask Replica album. The group rehearsed Van Vliet's difficult compositions for eight months, living communally in their small rented house in the Woodland Hills suburb of Los Angeles. With only two bedrooms the band members would find sleep in various corners of one, while Vliet occupied the other and rehearsals were accomplished in the main living area. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. At various times one or another of the group members was "put in the barrel", with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission.[63] Guitarist Bill Harkleroad complained that his fingers were a "bloody mess" as a result of secondnameplaceholder's orders that he use heavy strings.[64] Drummer John French described the situation as "cultlike"[65] and a visiting friend said "the environment in that house was positively Mansonesque".[5] Their material circumstances were dire. With no income other than welfare and contributions from relatives, the group barely survived and were even arrested for shoplifting food (Zappa bailed them out).[66] French has recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month.[27] A visitor described their appearance as "cadaverous" and said that "they all looked in poor health". Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for 14 or more hours a day.\n

French writes of being punched by band members, thrown into walls, kicked, punched in the face by secondnameplaceholder hard enough to draw blood, being attacked with a sharp broomstick.[67] Eventually secondnameplaceholder, French says, threatened to throw him out an upper floor window. He admits complicity in similarly attacking his bandmates during "talks" aimed at them. In the end, after the album's recording, secondnameplaceholder ejected French from the band by throwing him down a set of stairs, telling him to "Take a walk, man" after not responding in a desired manner to a request to "play a strawberry" on the drums. secondnameplaceholder replaced French with drummer Jeff Bruschel, an acquaintance of Hayden. Referred to as "Fake Drumbo" (playing on French's drumset) this final act resulted in French's name not appearing on the album credits, either as a player or arranger. Bruschel toured with the band to Europe but was replaced by the next recording.\n

(The band did watch Federico Fellini's 1963 film 8½ during the creation of the album). It took the band about eight months to mold the songs into shape, with French bearing primary responsibility for transposing and shaping Vliet's piano fragments into guitar and bass lines, which were mostly notated on paper.[69] Harkleroad in 1998 said in retrospect: "We're dealing with a strange person, coming from a place of being a sculptor/painter, using music as his idiom. He was getting more into that part of who he was instead of this blues singer."[68] The band had rehearsed the songs so thoroughly that the instrumental tracks for 21 of the songs were recorded in a single four and a half hour recording session.[69] Van Vliet spent the next few days overdubbing the vocals. The album's cover artwork was photographed and designed by Cal Schenkel and shows Van Vliet wearing the raw head of a carp, bought from a local fish market and fashioned into a mask by Schenkel.[70]\n

The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an iconoclastic whole of contrapuntal tempos, featuring slide guitar, polyrhythmic drumming (with French's drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and bass clarinet. Van Vliet's vocals range from his signature Howlin' Wolf-inspired growl to frenzied falsetto to laconic, casual ramblings.\n

It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not."[27]\n

Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band.[71] Last, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.[15]\n

However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era."[72] In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by Rolling Stone in their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: "On first listen, Trout Mask Replica sounds like raw Delta blues", with secondnameplaceholder "singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day for months on end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.) Tracks such as 'Ella Guru' and 'My Human Gets Me Blues' are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as Tom Waits and PJ Harvey."[11] Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process "forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable".[73]\n

But I'd like to. Very great played at high volume when you're feeling shitty, because you'll never feel as shitty as this record."[74] BBC disc jockey John Peel said of the album: "If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then Trout Mask Replica is probably that work."[75] It was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry in 2011.\n

An album with "a very coherent structure"[attribution needed] in the Magic Band's "most experimental and visionary stage",[attribution needed][76] it was Van Vliet's most commercially successful in the United Kingdom, spending twenty weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 20. An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop, silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and secondnameplaceholder kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several programs related to music.[77][78]\n

Lick My Decals Off, Baby was the first record on which the band was credited as "The" Magic Band, rather than "His" Magic Band. Journalist Irwin Chusid interprets this change as "a grudging concession of its members' at least semiautonomous humanity".[71] Robert Christgau gave the album an A−, commenting, "secondnameplaceholder's famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny."[74] Due to licensing disputes, Lick My Decals Off, Baby was unavailable on CD for many years, though it remained in print on vinyl. It was ranked second in Uncut magazine's May 2010 list of The 50 Greatest Lost Albums.[79] In 2011, the album became available for download on the iTunes Store.[80]\n

The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an iconoclastic whole of contrapuntal tempos, featuring slide guitar, polyrhythmic drumming (with French's drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and bass clarinet. Van Vliet's vocals range from his signature Howlin' Wolf-inspired growl to frenzied falsetto to laconic, casual ramblings.\n

It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not."[27]\n

Winner's article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band.[71] Last, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.[15]\n

However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era."[72] In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by Rolling Stone in their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: "On first listen, Trout Mask Replica sounds like raw Delta blues", with secondnameplaceholder "singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day for months on end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.) Tracks such as 'Ella Guru' and 'My Human Gets Me Blues' are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as Tom Waits and PJ Harvey."[11] Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process "forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable".[73]\n

But I'd like to. Very great played at high volume when you're feeling shitty, because you'll never feel as shitty as this record."[74] BBC disc jockey John Peel said of the album: "If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then Trout Mask Replica is probably that work."[75] It was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry in 2011.\n

An album with "a very coherent structure"[attribution needed] in the Magic Band's "most experimental and visionary stage",[attribution needed][76] it was Van Vliet's most commercially successful in the United Kingdom, spending twenty weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 20. An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop, silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and secondnameplaceholder kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several programs related to music.[77][78]\n

Lick My Decals Off, Baby was the first record on which the band was credited as "The" Magic Band, rather than "His" Magic Band. Journalist Irwin Chusid interprets this change as "a grudging concession of its members' at least semiautonomous humanity".[71] Robert Christgau gave the album an A−, commenting, "secondnameplaceholder's famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny."[74] Due to licensing disputes, Lick My Decals Off, Baby was unavailable on CD for many years, though it remained in print on vinyl. It was ranked second in Uncut magazine's May 2010 list of The 50 Greatest Lost Albums.[79] In 2011, the album became available for download on the iTunes Store.[80]\n

Released by Virgin Records during the post-punk scene, the music was now accessible to a younger, more receptive audience. He was interviewed in a feature report on KABC-TV's Channel 7 Eyewitness News in which he was hailed as "the father of the new wave. One of the most important American composers of the last fifty years, [and] a primitive genius"; Van Vliet said at this period, "I'm doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the catatonic state ... and I think there is one right now."[100] Huey of Allmusic cited the Doc at the Radar Station as being "... generally acclaimed as the strongest album of his comeback, and by some as his best since Trout Mask Replica", "even if the firstnameplaceholder's voice isn't quite what it once was, Doc at the Radar Station is an excellent, focused consolidation of secondnameplaceholder's past and then-present".[101] Van Vliet's biographer Mike Barnes speaks of "revamping work built on skeletal ideas and fragments that would have mouldered away in the vaults had they not been exhumed and transformed into full-blown, totally convincing new material".[5] During this period, Van Vliet made two appearances on David Letterman's late night television program on NBC, and also performed on Saturday Night Live.\n

He returned to making secular music in 2006.[3][4][5] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.[6]\n

In 1979, he auctioned all of his guitars for charity,[12] and left his musical career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has since bought back at least one of these guitars as a result of the efforts of his son Yoriyos.[13]  He was embroiled in a long-running controversy regarding comments he made in 1989 about the death fatwa on author Salman Rushdie. His current stance is that he never supported the fatwa: “I was cleverly framed by certain questions. I never supported the fatwa."[14] He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace as well as other humanitarian awards.\n
                                                                                                                               In 2006, he returned to pop music – releasing his first new studio album of new pop songs in 28 years, entitled An Other Cup.[15][16] With that release and subsequent ones, he dropped the surname "Islam" from the album cover art – using the stage name Yusuf as a mononym.[16] In 2009, he released the album Roadsinger and, in 2014, he released the album Tell 'Em I'm Gone and began his first US tour since 1978.[17]  His second North American tour since his resurgence, featuring 12 shows in intimate venues, ran from 12 September to 7 October 2016.[18] In 2017, he released the album The Laughing Apple, now using the stage name Yusuf / firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, using the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder name for the first time in 39 years. In September 2020, he released Tea for the Tillerman 2, a reimagining of his classic album Tea for the Tillerman to celebrate its 50th anniversary.\n

He was considered a fresh-faced teen star, placing several single releases in the British pop music charts.[38] Some of that success was attributed to the pirate radio station Wonderful Radio London, which gained him fans by playing his records. In August 1967, he went on the air with other recording artists who had benefited from the station to mourn its closure.[39][40]\n

The album is now most notable for his song "The First Cut Is the Deepest", a song he sold for £30 (equivalent to £500 in 2019[25]) to P. P. Arnold that became a massive hit for her[41] and an international hit for Keith Hampshire, Rod Stewart, James Morrison, and Sheryl Crow. Forty years after he recorded the first demo of the song, it earned him back-to-back ASCAP "Songwriter of the Year" awards, in 2005 and 2006.[42][43]\n

During this time secondnameplaceholder began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut."[36]\n

He admits having purposefully sabotaged his own contract with Hurst, making outlandishly expensive orchestral demands and threatening legal action, which resulted in his goal: release from his contract with Deram Records, a sub-label of Decca Records.[36]\n

After hiring agent Barry Krost, who had arranged for an audition with Chris Blackwell of Island Records, Blackwell offered him a "chance to record [his songs] whenever and with whomever he liked and, more importantly to firstnameplaceholder, however he liked".[45] With Krost's recommendation, secondnameplaceholder signed with Paul Samwell-Smith, previously the bassist of the Yardbirds, to be his new producer.[46]\n
 The first single released from Mona Bone Jakon was "Lady D'Arbanville", which secondnameplaceholder wrote about his young American girlfriend Patti D'Arbanville. The record, with a madrigal sound unlike most music played on pop radio, with sounds of djembes and bass in addition to secondnameplaceholder' and Davies' guitars, reached number 8 in the UK.[37] It was the first of his hits to get real airplay in the US.[36] It sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a gold record in 1971.[50] Other songs written for D'Arbanville included "Maybe You're Right" and "Just Another Night".[51] In addition, the song "Pop Star", about his experience as a teen star, and "Katmandu", featuring Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel playing flute, were featured. Mona Bone Jakon was an early example of the solo singer-songwriter album format that was becoming popular for other artists as well. Rolling Stone magazine compared its popularity with that of Elton John's Tumbleweed Connection, saying it was played "across the board, across radio formats".[52]\n

This is one of the few music videos that secondnameplaceholder made, other than simple videos of concert performances.[citation needed]\n

Several compilation albums were released before and after he stopped recording. After secondnameplaceholder left Decca Records they bundled his first two albums together as a set, hoping to ride the commercial tide of his early success; later his newer labels did the same, and he himself released compilations.  The most successful of the compilation albums was the 1975 Greatest Hits which has sold over 4 million copies in the United States. In May 2003 he received his first Platinum Europe Award from the IFPI for Remember firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, The Ultimate Collection, indicating over one million European sales.[70]\n Charles secondnameplaceholder Jr. (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), nicknamed "Bird" and "Yardbird", was an American jazz saxophonist, band leader and composer.[1] secondnameplaceholder was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop,[2] a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. secondnameplaceholder was a blazingly fast virtuoso and introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Primarily a player of the alto saxophone, secondnameplaceholder's tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber.\n

Though the band was being courted by major labels, they signed to independent label SST Records in 1988 to release their debut album, Ultramega OK, for which they earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990.[37] The band subsequently signed with A&M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign to a major label.[29]\n

Following the album's release, Yamamoto left the band to finish his master's degree in physical chemistry at Western Washington University.[38] He was replaced by former Nirvana guitarist Jason Everman. Everman was fired following Soundgarden's tour supporting Louder Than Love. In 1990, the band was joined by a new bassist, Ben Shepherd.[39]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Along with Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden quickly became one of the most successful bands from Seattle's emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s. With Shepherd, the new line-up recorded Badmotorfinger in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene. Badmotorfinger included the singles "Jesus firstnameplaceholdert Pose", "Outshined" and "Rusty Cage". The three singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the videos for "Outshined" and "Rusty Cage" gained considerable airtime on MTV. The song "Jesus firstnameplaceholdert Pose" and its music video was the subject of widespread controversy in 1991, and the video was removed from MTV's playlist. "Rusty Cage" was later covered by Johnny Cash on his 1996 album, Unchained. It also appeared on the fictional radio station Radio X in the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and in the 32-bit version of Road Rash. "Room a Thousand Years Wide" was released (along with the B-side "HIV Baby") as a 7" single through Sub Pop's Single of the Month club a full year before the release of Badmotorfinger, and later re-recorded for the album. Badmotorfinger exposed Soundgarden to its first mainstream success: it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992,[37] and was later ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of Guitar World on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time.[40]\n
 The band's fourth studio album, 1994's Superunknown, proved to be the band's breakthrough album. Upon its release in March 1994, Superunknown debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[41] The album launched several successful singles, including "Spoonman" and "Black Hole Sun", and brought Soundgarden international recognition. Superunknown achieved quintuple platinum status in the United States,[42] triple platinum status in Canada,[43] and gold status in the United Kingdom,[44] Sweden,[45] and the Netherlands.[46] Rolling Stone gave Superunknown four out of five stars. Reviewer J.D. Considine said Superunknown "demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career." Considine criticized "Black Hole Sun" and "Half", stating that the former is "not a very good song" while the latter "is the virtual definition of a B-side."[47] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that "Superunknown actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy-metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept." He added that "Soundgarden ... want[s] something different from standard heavy metal."[48] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A, saying "Soundgarden is pumped and primed on Superunknown, and they deliver the goods." He praised it as a "hard-rock milestone—a boiling vat of volcanic power, record-making smarts, and '90s anomie and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal."[49] The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995.[50] Two singles from Superunknown, "Black Hole Sun" and "Spoonman", won Grammy Awards,[37] and the music video for "Black Hole Sun" won a MTV Video Music Award and a Clio Award.[51] Superunknown was ranked number 336 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time,[52] and "Black Hole Sun" was ranked number 25 on VH1's list of the 100 greatest songs of the '90s.[53]\n

The album spawned several singles, including "Pretty Noose", "Burden in My Hand" and "Blow Up the Outside World". The album was notably less heavy than the group's preceding albums, and marked a further departure from the band's grunge roots.

It debuted at number 17 on the American Billboard charts. Among the artists who accompanied him on his second solo release was friend Gary Lucas, who contributed acoustic guitar to some of the tracks. secondnameplaceholder stated that he was always writing, and that there were some songs that he was not able to put onto an Audioslave album.[83] While recording his second solo album, secondnameplaceholder was involved in a motorcycle accident. He was apparently "rear-ended by a truck in Studio City, Los Angeles while riding his motorcycle" and "catapulted 20 feet into the air." He was able to walk away from the accident, but had severe cuts and bruises. He returned to the studio later that day.[84]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Charles Edward Anderson secondnameplaceholder (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. Nicknamed the "Father of Rock and Roll", secondnameplaceholder refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as "Maybellene" (1955), "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956), "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958).[1] Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, secondnameplaceholder was a major influence on subsequent rock music.[2]\n
                                                      Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, secondnameplaceholder had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, secondnameplaceholder settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, secondnameplaceholder began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio.[3] His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded "Maybellene"—secondnameplaceholder's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart.[4]\n
 By the end of the 1950s secondnameplaceholder was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, secondnameplaceholder's Club Bandstand.[5] He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.[3][6][7] After his release in 1963, secondnameplaceholder had several more hits, including "No Particular Place to Go", "You Never Can Tell", and "Nadine". However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality.[3] In 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of "My Ding-a-Ling" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.\n

Goode", "Maybellene", and "Rock and Roll Music".[10] secondnameplaceholder's "Johnny B. Goode" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.[11]\n firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (originally known as The firstnameplaceholder Chicago secondnameplaceholder) is a British blues rock band. The band was formed in Stafford, England, in 1967 by vocalist and harmonica player Colin Cooper (1939–2008), guitarist and vocalist Pete Haycock (1951–2013), guitarist Derek Holt (b. 1949), bassist and keyboardist Richard Jones (b. 1949), drummer George Newsome (b. 1947), and keyboardist Arthur Wood (1929–2005).[1]\n firstnameplaceholder Randolph secondnameplaceholder (November 21, 1904 – May 19, 1969), nicknamed "Hawk" and sometimes "Bean", was an American jazz tenor saxophonist.[1] One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as Joachim E. Berendt explained: "there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn".[2] secondnameplaceholder biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to secondnameplaceholder as "mooing" and "rubbery belches."[3]  secondnameplaceholder cited as influences Happy Caldwell, Stump Evans, and Prince Robinson, although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet. secondnameplaceholder' virtuosic, arpeggiated approach to improvisation, with his characteristic rich, emotional, loud, and vibrato-laden tonal style, was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry, Charlie Barnet, Tex Beneke, Ben Webster, Vido Musso, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, and Don Byas, and through them the later tenormen, Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, Flip Phillips, Ike Quebec, Al Sears,[4] Paul Gonsalves, and Lucky Thompson.[5]  While secondnameplaceholder became well known with swing music during the big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s.[1]\n

 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder gained popularity following the release of its debut album, August and Everything After (1993). Featuring the breakthrough hit single "Mr. Jones" (1993), the album sold more than seven million copies in the United States. The band received two Grammy Awards nominations in 1994, one for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal (for "Round Here") and one for Best New Artist. Other hit singles include "Rain King", "A Long December", "Hanginaround", and a cover version of Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi".[6] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder received a 2004 Academy Award nomination for the single "Accidentally in Love", which was included in the film Shrek 2. The band has sold more than 20 million albums and is known for its dynamic live performances.\n                                                                           firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, also referred to as firstnameplaceholder and CCR, was an American rock band that recorded and performed from 1959 to 1972 under various names before settling on the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder name in 1967. The band initially consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty; his brother, rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty; bassist Stu Cook; and drummer Doug Clifford. These members had played together since 1959, first as the Blue Velvets and later as the Golliwogs.[1]\n
 CCR's musical style encompassed roots rock,[2][3] swamp rock,[4] blues rock,[5] Southern rock,[6] country rock,[7] and blue-eyed soul.[8] Despite their San Francisco Bay Area origin, the band played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography. The band's songs rarely dealt with romantic love, concentrating instead on political and socially conscious lyrics about topics such as the Vietnam War.[9] The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock festival in Upstate New York, and was the first major act signed to appear there.[10]\n
                                                         CCR disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's ongoing disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz created further protracted court battles, and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at firstnameplaceholder's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[11][12]\n

It has been awarded 10x platinum, indicating it has sold over 10 million copies.[15] Rolling Stone ranked them 82nd on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[16]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder are a rock band, formed in Melbourne in 1985. Its founding members were New Zealander Neil Finn (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and Australians Paul Hester (drums) and Nick Seymour (bass). Later band members included Neil Finn's brother, Tim Finn, and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod.[1][2]  The current line-up includes Finn's sons Elroy and Liam and the American keyboard player Mitchell Froom.  Neil Finn and Nick Seymour have been the sole constant members of the group since its formation.\n
 Originally active from 1985 to 1996, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had consistent commercial and critical success in  New Zealand and Australia[3][4][5] and international chart success in two phases, beginning with a self-titled debut album that reached number 12 on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits "Don't Dream It's Over" and "Something So Strong".[6][7] Further international success came in the UK, Europe and South Africa with their third and fourth albums (Woodface and Together Alone) and the compilation album Recurring Dream, which included the hits "Fall at Your Feet", "Weather with You", "Distant Sun", "Locked Out", "Instinct" and "Not the Girl You Think You Are".[8][9] Neil and Tim Finn were each awarded an OBE in June 1993 for their contributions to the music of New Zealand.[10]\n
                                                  In June 1996, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder announced that it would disband. The band played several farewell concerts that year, including the "Farewell to the World" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney.[1][8][11] On 26 March 2005, Hester died by suicide, aged 46.[12] In 2006, the group re-formed with drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums (in 2007 and 2010), each of which reached number one on Australia's album chart.[4] After several years of inactivity, it was announced a revised line-up of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder would tour the UK in 2020.

Allmusic said that Finn "has consistently proven his knack for crafting high-quality songs that combine irresistible melodies with meticulous lyrical detail."[53] Neil's brother Tim was an early and important musical influence. Neil first saw Tim play with Split Enz in 1972, and said "that performance and those first songs made a lasting impression on me."[54] His mother was another significant musical influence, encouraging him to listen to a variety of genres, including Irish folk music and Māori music. She would play piano at family parties and encourage Neil and Tim to accompany her.\n

He also designed some of the costumes worn by the group, notably those from the cover of the group's debut album firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. Seymour collaborated with Finn and Hester on the set design of some of their early music videos, including "Don't Dream It's Over" and "Better Be Home Soon". Since the band reunited, Seymour has again designed their album covers.[2]\n

A leading figure in the music industry, secondnameplaceholder is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone placed him among its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and named him the "Greatest Rock Star Ever" following his death in 2016.\n

He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. "Space Oddity", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of secondnameplaceholder's single "Starman" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, secondnameplaceholder's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as "plastic soul", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single "Fame" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, secondnameplaceholder starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released Station to Station. In 1977, he further confounded expectations with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the "Berlin Trilogy". "Heroes" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n

He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance; its title track topped both the UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, secondnameplaceholder continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, secondnameplaceholder returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).\n

His back catalogue was now highly sought after: The Man Who Sold the World had been re-released in 1972 along with Space Oddity. "Life on Mars?", from Hunky Dory, was released in June 1973 and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Entering the same chart in September, secondnameplaceholder's novelty record from 1967, "The Laughing Gnome", reached number six.[62] Pin Ups, a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in his version of the McCoys's "Sorrow" and itself peaking at number one, making firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of secondnameplaceholder albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.[63]\n

Its title-track, though only reaching number 24 in the UK singles chart, gained lasting popularity, and within months had been released in both German and French.[100] Towards the end of the year, secondnameplaceholder performed the song for Marc Bolan's television show Marc, and again two days later for Bing Crosby's final CBS television Christmas special, when he joined Crosby in "Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy", a version of "The Little Drummer Boy" with a new, contrapuntal verse. Five years later, the duet proved a worldwide seasonal hit, charting in the UK at number three on Christmas Day, 1982.[101]\n

By now he had broken his drug addiction; biographer firstnameplaceholder Buckley writes that Isolar II was "secondnameplaceholder's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends."[102] Recordings from the tour made up the live album Stage, released the same year.[103] secondnameplaceholder also recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's classical composition Peter and the Wolf, which was released as an album in May 1978.[104]\n
 The final piece in what secondnameplaceholder called his "triptych", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of the other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places incorporating Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from secondnameplaceholder's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop.[105] The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, "It would be fair to call it secondnameplaceholder's Sergeant Pepper ... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of secondnameplaceholder's partnership with Eno." Lodger reached number four in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "Boys Keep Swinging" and "DJ".[106][107] Towards the end of the year, secondnameplaceholder and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.[108]\n                                                          firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, actor and comedian.

 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976–1984). The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV.[12][13] Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals) and Roger Glover (bass), who joined founding members Jon Lord (keyboards), Ian Paice (drums) and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals) (and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder member still in the band.\n

It was followed by hit singles including "Romeo and Juliet" (1981), "Private Investigations" (1982), "Twisting by the Pool" (1983), "Money for Nothing" (1985), and "Walk of Life" (1985).[2] Their most commercially successful album, Brothers in Arms (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc,[3][4] and is the eighth-bestselling album in UK history.

 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' sound draws from various influences including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz.[6] Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who lasted from the beginning of the band's existence, to the end. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told Rolling Stone: "A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest."[7] They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined reunion offers.[8]\n

Williams was temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded the album's drum parts before leaving for other commitments.[41] Both Hakim and Williams are credited on the album,[40] although Williams' single contribution was the improvised cadenza at the beginning of "Money for Nothing".. Williams would be back in the band for the music videos and the 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour that followed.[40]\n

In 1990 secondnameplaceholder charted with “Reputation” – the last of 25 Top 40 UK hits in which she features.\n

 In November 1968 the album's lead single, "Son of a Preacher Man", was issued. It was written by John Hurley and Ronnie Wilkins.[71] Credited as "Son-of-a Preacher Man" on UK, US and other releases, it became an international hit, reaching no. 9 in the UK singles chart and no. 10 on  Billboard's Hot 100 in January 1969. In continental Europe the single reached the Top Ten in the Austrian, Dutch and Swiss charts.[72] In 1970 secondnameplaceholder was nominated for the Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female award at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to "Is That All There Is?" by Peggy Lee, whom secondnameplaceholder often cited as an influence.[73][74] In 1987 Rolling Stone magazine placed the single at no. 77 in its critics' list The 100 Best Singles of the Last 25 Years. In 2002 the record ranked 43 in the 100 Greatest Singles of All Time, as voted for by New Musical Express critics. In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked it 240 in its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[75]  "Son of a Preacher Man" found a new audience when it was included on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's 1994 film Pulp Fiction. The soundtrack reached no. 21 on Billboard's Billboard 200 album chart and at the time went platinum (100,000 units) in Canada alone.[76] It is thought that "Son of a Preacher Man" contributed to the sales of the soundtrack album, which sold more than 2 million copies in the US.[77][78]\n

Homme later confirmed that the band is playing the second stage at Download.[22] In June 2015, the band announced that their next album, Zipper Down, would be released on October 2. The first single from the album, titled "Complexity", was made available for streaming on Pitchfork Media's website.[23][24][25]\n Ray Edward secondnameplaceholder (/ˈkɒkrən/; October 3, 1938 – April 17, 1960) was an American rock and roll musician. secondnameplaceholder's songs, such as "Twenty Flight Rock", "Summertime Blues", "C'mon Everybody", and "Somethin' Else", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.[1] He experimented with multitrack recording, distortion techniques, and overdubbing even on his earliest singles.[2] He played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.[1] His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death he achieved iconic status.[3]\n
                  secondnameplaceholder was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.[2] In 1954, he formed a duet with the guitarist Hank secondnameplaceholder (no relation). When they split the following year, firstnameplaceholder began a songwriting career with Jerry Capehart. His first success came when he performed the song "Twenty Flight Rock" in the film The Girl Can't Help It, starring Jayne Mansfield. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with Liberty Records and his first record for the label, Sittin' in the Balcony, rose to number 18 on the Billboard charts.\n

He had just performed at the Bristol Hippodrome. Though his best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           firstnameplaceholder Jane secondnameplaceholder  (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer, sometimes referred to as the First Lady of Song, Queen of Jazz, and Lady firstnameplaceholder. She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.\n

Her rendition of the nursery rhyme "A-Tisket, A-Tasket" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, secondnameplaceholder left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career.\n

With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      secondnameplaceholder had a number of famous jazz musicians and soloists as sidemen over her long career. The trumpeters Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie, the guitarist Herb Ellis, and the pianists Tommy Flanagan, Oscar Peterson, Lou Levy, Paul Smith, Jimmy Rowles, and Ellis Larkins all worked with secondnameplaceholder mostly in live, small group settings.\n
 Possibly secondnameplaceholder's greatest unrealized collaboration (in terms of popular music) was a studio or live album with Frank Sinatra. The two appeared on the same stage only periodically over the years, in television specials in 1958 and 1959, and again on 1967's A Man and His Music + firstnameplaceholder + Jobim, a show that also featured Antônio Carlos Jobim. Pianist Paul Smith has said, "firstnameplaceholder loved working with [Frank]. Sinatra gave her his dressing-room on A Man and His Music and couldn't do enough for her." When asked, Norman Granz would cite "complex contractual reasons" for the fact that the two artists never recorded together.[42][56] secondnameplaceholder's appearance with Sinatra and Count Basie in June 1974 for a series of concerts at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, was seen as an important incentive for Sinatra to return from his self-imposed retirement of the early 1970s. The shows were a great success, and September 1975 saw them gross $1,000,000 in two weeks on Broadway, in a triumvirate with the Count Basie Orchestra.\n

Her first marriage was in 1941, to Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer and local dockworker. The marriage was annulled in 1942.[63] Her second marriage was in December 1947, to the famous bass player Ray Brown, whom she had met while on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band a year earlier. Together they adopted a child born to secondnameplaceholder's half-sister, Frances, whom they christened Ray Brown Jr. With secondnameplaceholder and Brown often busy touring and recording, the child was largely raised by his mother's aunt, Virginia. secondnameplaceholder and Brown divorced in 1953, due to the various career pressures both were experiencing at the time, though they would continue to perform together.[9]\n

She had even gone as far as furnishing an apartment in Oslo, but the affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months' hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman to whom he had previously been engaged.[64]\n

Trumpet player Mario Bauzá, who played behind secondnameplaceholder in her early years with Chick Webb, remembered that "she didn't hang out much. When she got into the band, she was dedicated to her music....She was a lonely girl around New York, just kept herself to herself, for the gig."[42] When, later in her career, the Society of Singers named an award after her, secondnameplaceholder explained, "I don't want to say the wrong thing, which I always do but I think I do better when I sing."[19]\n

She was awarded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Equal Justice Award and the American Black Achievement Award.[66] In 1949, Norman Granz recruited secondnameplaceholder for the Jazz at the Philharmonic tour.[67] The Jazz at the Philharmonic tour would specifically target segregated venues. Granz required promoters to ensure that there was no "colored" or "white" seating. He ensured secondnameplaceholder was to receive equal pay and accommodations regardless of her sex and race. If the conditions were not met shows were cancelled.[68]\n

In 2003, aged 34, he died in Los Angeles, California, from two stab wounds to the chest.[8] The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted or the result of homicide.[9] At the time of his death, secondnameplaceholder was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was posthumously completed and released in 2004.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 secondnameplaceholder said: "I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately."[25] secondnameplaceholder felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: "The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest—Mudhoney and Nirvana—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off."[27]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               One of secondnameplaceholder's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks.[28] The same year, secondnameplaceholder released a split 7-inch record with Pete Krebs via Slo-Mo Records, contributing the track "No Confidence Man".[29]\n
 In 1995, secondnameplaceholder's self-titled album was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a style of recording similar to Roman Candle, but with hints of growth and experimentation.[citation needed] Though the majority of the album was recorded by secondnameplaceholder alone, friend and The Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on "St. Ides Heaven", and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on "Single File". Several songs made reference to drugs, but secondnameplaceholder explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically.[30] Looking back, secondnameplaceholder felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him "a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person" and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.[31]\n

                                          The final album secondnameplaceholder completed, Figure 8, was released on April 18, 2000. It featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England, with an obvious Beatles influence in the songwriting and production. The album garnered favorable reviews,[50] and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200[39] and 37 on the UK Album Charts.[40] The album received praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a "sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures".[46] However, some reviewers felt that secondnameplaceholder's trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the lyrics to "the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary".[51]\n

An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, book-ended by television appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and the Late Show with David Letterman. However, secondnameplaceholder's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.[11]\n

Some are more acoustic, but there aren't too many like that. Lately I've just been making up a lot of noise."[25]\n

He is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century and is often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll". His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.\n

His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. secondnameplaceholder, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of secondnameplaceholder's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. secondnameplaceholder's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll.\n

Drafted into military service in 1958, secondnameplaceholder relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special firstnameplaceholder, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, secondnameplaceholder gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.\n

He is the best-selling solo music artist of all time, and was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, R&B, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. secondnameplaceholder holds several records; the most RIAA certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, and the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, secondnameplaceholder was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump.\n

As they were about to abort and go home, secondnameplaceholder took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's "That's All Right". Moore recalled, "All of a sudden, firstnameplaceholder just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open ... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.[59] Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played "That's All Right" on his Red, Hot, and Blue show.[60] Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing secondnameplaceholder on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.[61] During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed "slapback". A single was pressed with "That's All Right" on the A-side and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" on the reverse.[62]\n

A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led secondnameplaceholder to shake his legs as he performed: his wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.[64] Moore recalled, "During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild".[65] Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode his bass, hitting double licks that secondnameplaceholder would later remember as "really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something".[65]\nSoon after, Moore and Black left their old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with secondnameplaceholder regularly, and DJ/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions,[66] and secondnameplaceholder quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, "His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick."[67] secondnameplaceholder made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry stage on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was "not bad" but did not suit the program.[68][69]\n

The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. secondnameplaceholder had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.[70] House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing secondnameplaceholder's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs.[71] Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged secondnameplaceholder for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales, including Houston, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas.[72]\n

 firstnameplaceholder made his first television appearance on the KSLA-TV television broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By early 1955, secondnameplaceholder's regular Hayride appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with secondnameplaceholder and brought him to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Parker—who claimed to be from West Virginia (he was actually Dutch)—had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from country singer turned Louisiana governor Jimmie Davis. Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked secondnameplaceholder on Snow's February tour.[76][77] When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw secondnameplaceholder for the first time: "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing. ... I just didn't know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it."[38]  By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the "R&B idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were "more in the country field", "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both".[78] This blend of styles made it difficult for secondnameplaceholder's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because "he sounded too much like a hillbilly."[79] The blend came to be known as rockabilly. At the time, secondnameplaceholder was variously billed as "The King of Western Bop", "The Hillbilly Cat", and "The Memphis Flash".[80]\n

So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him. They'd get a gang and try to waylay him or something."[83] The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose "Rock Around the Clock" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that secondnameplaceholder had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.[84]\n

After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire secondnameplaceholder's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.[86][c] secondnameplaceholder, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract.[87] Parker arranged with the owners of Hill & Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by secondnameplaceholder. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions.[88][d] By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.[91]\n

Moore recalled, "He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time."[128] At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen were added to the police security to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus.[129] firstnameplaceholder, secondnameplaceholder's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. The album includes "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear "in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique."[130] Assessing the musical and cultural impact of secondnameplaceholder's recordings from "That's All Right" through firstnameplaceholder, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become."[131]\n

After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.[111] His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: "Love Me Tender" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of secondnameplaceholder's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.[103] secondnameplaceholder would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.[132]\n

Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any secondnameplaceholder material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for 25 years, became known as the "Million Dollar Quartet" recordings.[133] The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that secondnameplaceholder merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales,[134] and Billboard's declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.[135] In his first full year at RCA, one of the music industry's largest companies, secondnameplaceholder had accounted for over 50 percent of the label's singles sales.[126]\n

The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues "menace, driven by secondnameplaceholder's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. firstnameplaceholder' singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic."[180] As a whole, the record "conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things", according to music historian John Robertson: "a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker".[181] Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.[182][183]\n

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Dave Marsh, it is "a masterpiece in which secondnameplaceholder immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement."[211] The album featured the hit single "In the Ghetto", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—secondnameplaceholder's first non-gospel top ten hit since "Bossa Nova Baby" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: "Suspicious Minds", "Don't Cry Daddy", and "Kentucky Rain".[212]\n

Following the success of the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker $28,000 for a one-week engagement. He responded, "That's fine for me, now how much can you get for firstnameplaceholder?"[213] In May, the brand new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, announced that it had booked secondnameplaceholder. He was scheduled to perform 57 shows over four weeks beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. secondnameplaceholder assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations.[214] Costume designer Bill Belew, responsible for the intense leather styling of the Comeback Special, created a new stage look for secondnameplaceholder, inspired by secondnameplaceholder's passion for karate.[215] Nonetheless, he was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker, who intended to make secondnameplaceholder's return the show business event of the year, oversaw a major promotional push. For his part, hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.[216]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                secondnameplaceholder took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, "Can't Help Falling in Love" (a song that would be his closing number for much of the 1970s).[217] At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as "The King", secondnameplaceholder gestured toward Fats Domino, who was taking in the scene. "No," secondnameplaceholder said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."[218] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for secondnameplaceholder to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.[219] Newsweek commented, "There are several unbelievable things about firstnameplaceholder, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars."[220] Rolling Stone called secondnameplaceholder "supernatural, his own resurrection."[221] In November, secondnameplaceholder's final non-concert film, Change of Habit, opened. The double album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. "Suspicious Minds" reached the top of the charts—secondnameplaceholder's first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.[222]\n

She recalled of their encounter, "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'"[223] secondnameplaceholder was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.[224]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       secondnameplaceholder returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album On Stage.[225] In late February, secondnameplaceholder performed six attendance-record–breaking shows at the Houston Astrodome.[226] In April, the single "The Wonder of You" was issued—a number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart, as well. MGM filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary firstnameplaceholder: That's the Way It Is. secondnameplaceholder was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless $50,000 was paid. secondnameplaceholder had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.[227] The FBI took the threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows. secondnameplaceholder went onstage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.[228][229]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The album, That's the Way It Is, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, "The authority of secondnameplaceholder's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for firstnameplaceholder."[230] After the end of his International engagement on September 7, secondnameplaceholder embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.[231]\n

Though he was no longer a major presence on the pop charts, five of those albums entered the top five of the country chart, and three went to number one: Promised Land (1975), From firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee (1976), and Moody Blue (1977).[282] Similarly, his singles in this era did not prove to be major pop hits, but secondnameplaceholder remained a significant force in the country and adult contemporary markets. Eight studio singles from this period released during his lifetime were top ten hits on one or both charts, four in 1974 alone. "My Boy" was a number-one adult contemporary hit in 1975, and "Moody Blue" topped the country chart and reached the second spot on the adult contemporary chart in 1976.[283] Perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of the era came that year, with what Greil Marcus described as his "apocalyptic attack" on the soul classic "Hurt".[284] "If he felt the way he sounded", Dave Marsh wrote of secondnameplaceholder's performance, "the wonder isn't that he had only a year left to live but that he managed to survive that long."[285]\n

Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts."[288] In Alexandria, Louisiana, he was on stage for less than an hour, and "was impossible to understand".[289] On March 31, secondnameplaceholder failed to perform in Baton Rouge, unable to get out of his hotel bed; a total of four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.[290] Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past secondnameplaceholder, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books."[291] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how secondnameplaceholder would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes.[292]\n

That month, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV special, firstnameplaceholder in Concert, to be aired in October. In the first, shot in Omaha on June 19, secondnameplaceholder's voice, Guralnick writes, "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project".[293] Two days later, in Rapid City, South Dakota, "he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was "framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks".[293] His final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena, on June 26.\n

His first post-Army single, the number-one hit "Stuck on You", is typical of this shift. RCA publicity materials referred to its "mild rock beat"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it "upbeat pop".[371] The number five "She's Not You" (1962) "integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop".[372] The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on firstnameplaceholder Is Back! was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as "Down in the Alley" and "Hi-Heel Sneakers".[373] secondnameplaceholder's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as "Are You Lonesome Tonight?", a number-one in 1960. "It's Now or Never", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan "'O sole mio" and concluding with a "full-voiced operatic cadence".[374] These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what secondnameplaceholder recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.[375]\n

He would record few new straight-ahead rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they were "hard to find".[376] A significant exception was "Burning Love", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, secondnameplaceholder's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of firstnameplaceholder in Memphis, as well as "Suspicious Minds", cut at the same sessions, reflected his new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.[377]\n

                                    Denny began steering the group towards traditional British music for their next two albums, What We Did on Our Holidays and Unhalfbricking (both 1969); the latter featured fiddler Dave "Swarb" Swarbrick, most notably on the song "A Sailor's Life", which laid the groundwork for British folk rock by being the first time a traditional British song was combined with a rock beat.[6] Shortly before the album's release, a crash on the M1 motorway killed Lamble and Jeannie Franklyn, Thompson's then-girlfriend; this resulted in the group retiring most of their prior material and turning entirely towards British folk music for their seminal album Liege & Lief, released the same year. This style became the band's focus ever since.[7] For this album Swarbrick joined full time alongside Dave Mattacks on drums. Both Denny and Hutchings left before the year's end; the latter replaced by Dave Pegg, who has remained the group's sole consistent member to this day; Thompson would leave after the recording of 1970's Full House.\n

Denny, whose partner Trevor Lucas had been a guitarist in the group since 1972, returned for the pop-oriented Rising for the Moon album in 1975 in a final bid to crack America; this effort failed, and after three more albums minus Denny and Lucas, the group disbanded in 1979.[8] They played a farewell concert in the village of Cropredy, Oxfordshire, where they had held small concerts since 1976, and this marked the beginning of the Cropredy Festival (since 2005 known as firstnameplaceholder's Cropredy secondnameplaceholder) which has become the largest folk festival in Britain, with annual attendances of 20,000.[9]\n

Allcock was replaced by Chris Leslie in 1996, and Gerry Conway replaced Mattacks in 1998, with this lineup remaining unchanged since and marking the longest-lasting of the group's history. Their 28th studio album, 50:50@50, released to mark their 50th anniversary, was released in 2017, and they continue to headline Cropredy each year.\n
 Despite little mainstream success – their only top 40 single being "Si Tu Dois Partir", a French-language cover of the Dylan song "If You Gotta Go, Go Now" from Unhalfbricking – firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder remain highly influential in British folk rock and British folk in general. Liege & Lief was named the "Most Influential Folk Album of All Time" at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2006, and Pegg's playing style, which incorporates jigs and reels into his basslines, has been imitated by many in the folk rock and folk punk genres.[10] Additionally, many former members went on to form or join other notable groups in the genre, including Fotheringay, Steeleye Span, and the Albion Band; along with solo careers, most notably Thompson and Denny.[11] Sandy Denny's career ended with her death in 1978, though she is now regarded as being amongst Britain's finest female singer-songwriters; her song "Who Knows Where the Time Goes?" – recorded by firstnameplaceholder on Unhalfbricking – has become a signature song for herself and the band.\n

While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism, African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music.[6] He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz, or classical.\n

Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he disapproved of drugs but supported their decriminalization and regulation.\n

Though he worked as an independent artist, secondnameplaceholder mostly relied on distribution agreements he had negotiated with the major record labels. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His honors include his 1995 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n

He fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer.[1]:65–66 They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until secondnameplaceholder's death.\n

It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined secondnameplaceholder's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.[27]:5 Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the counterculture of the 1960s.[27]:38–43 As secondnameplaceholder put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."[9]:135–138 At the same time, secondnameplaceholder had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, Lumpy Gravy, released by Capitol Records in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. secondnameplaceholder took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968.[9]:140–141 It is an "incredible ambitious musical project",[27]:56 a "monument to John Cage",[20]:86 which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical audio editing techniques.[27]:56[30][nb 4]\n

This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.[31]:62–69 As a result, secondnameplaceholder and his wife Gail, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.[9]:140–141 Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of secondnameplaceholder's music. Everything was directed by secondnameplaceholder using hand signals.[9]:147 Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, secondnameplaceholder managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by secondnameplaceholder to pretend that it was a "gook baby".[1]:94\n

Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968).[32] It was produced by secondnameplaceholder, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, secondnameplaceholder produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena.[20]:90[28]:15 He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song "Tomorrow Never Knows".[33] The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.[nb 5] The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom secondnameplaceholder met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous secondnameplaceholder and Mothers albums.[16]:88\n

It represented a collection of doo-wop songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.[27]:58 secondnameplaceholder later noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same ... to doo-wop in the fifties?"[1]:88 A theme from Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is heard during one song.\n

The first appearance was on an episode of their TV series, "The Monkees Blow Their Minds", where secondnameplaceholder, dressed up as Mike Nesmith, interviews Nesmith who is dressed up as secondnameplaceholder. After the interview, secondnameplaceholder destroys a car with a sledgehammer as the song "Mother People" plays. He later provided a cameo in the Monkees' movie Head where, leading a cow, he tells Davy Jones "the youth of America depends on you to show them the way." secondnameplaceholder had respect for what the Monkees were doing, and offered Micky Dolenz a position in the Mothers. RCA/Columbia/Colgems would not allow Dolenz out of his contract.[9]:158–159\n

While performing at Casino de Montreux in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.[1]:112–115 Immortalized in Deep Purple's song "Smoke on the Water", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album Swiss Cheese/Fire, released legally as part of secondnameplaceholder's Beat the Boots II compilation. After losing $50,000 (equivalent to $320,000 in 2020) worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the Rainbow Theatre, London, with rented gear. During the encore, an audience member jealous because of his girlfriend's infatuation with secondnameplaceholder pushed him off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit.[38] The band thought secondnameplaceholder had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed larynx, which ultimately caused his voice to drop a third after healing.[1]:112–115\n

Upon return to the stage in September 1972, secondnameplaceholder was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. secondnameplaceholder noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "Dancin' Fool"), resulting in chronic back pain.[1]:112–115 Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.\n

This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.[39]\n

In their place, secondnameplaceholder and Cohen created DiscReet Records, also distributed by Warner Bros.[9]:231 secondnameplaceholder continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album Apostrophe (') (1974), which reached a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts[40] helped by the No. 86 chart hit "Don't Eat The Yellow Snow".[41] Other albums from the period are Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as "Dinah-Moe Humm" and "Montana", and the albums Roxy & Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult jazz fusion songs in such pieces as "Inca Roads", "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" and "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)".[27]:114–122 A live recording from 1974, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), captures "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–1975 band".[27]:114–122 secondnameplaceholder released Bongo Fury (1975), which featured a live recording at the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin from a tour the same year that reunited him with Captain Beefheart for a brief period.[9]:248 They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of secondnameplaceholder's life.[9]:372\n

Kenyon, "The Illinois Enema Bandit", in which Don Pardo provides the opening narrative. Like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references,[27]:132 leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content.[27]:134[27]:261–262 secondnameplaceholder dismissed the criticism by noting that he was a journalist reporting on life as he saw it.[9]:234 Predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: "What do you make of a society that is so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you the moment you hear them?"[25] The remaining albums released by Warner Bros. Records without secondnameplaceholder's approval were Studio Tan in 1978 and Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites in 1979. These releases were largely overlooked in midst of the press about secondnameplaceholder's legal problems.[27]:138\n

 The double album Sheik Yerbouti was the first release on secondnameplaceholder Records, and contained the Grammy-nominated single "Dancin' Fool", which reached No. 45 on the Billboard charts,[49] and "Jewish Princess", which received attention when a Jewish group, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), attempted to prevent the song from receiving radio airplay due to its alleged anti-Semitic lyrics.[9]:234 secondnameplaceholder vehemently denied any anti-Semitic sentiments, and dismissed the ADL as a "noisemaking organization that tries to apply pressure on people in order to manufacture a stereotype image of Jews that suits their idea of a good time."[50] The album's commercial success was attributable in part to "Bobby Brown". Due to its explicit lyrics about a young man's encounter with a "dyke by the name of Freddie", the song did not get airplay in the U.S., but it topped the charts in several European countries where English is not the primary language.[16]:351 The triple LP Joe's Garage featured lead singer Ike Willis as the voice of the character "Joe" in a rock opera about the danger of political systems,[27]:140 the suppression of freedom of speech and music—inspired in part by the Islamic revolution that had made music illegal within its jurisdiction at the time[9]:277—and about the "strange relationship Americans have with sex and sexual frankness".[27]:140 The album contains rock songs like "Catholic Girls" (a riposte to the controversies of "Jewish Princess"),[28]:59 "Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up", and the title track, as well as extended live-recorded guitar improvisations combined with a studio backup band dominated by drummer Vinnie Colaiuta (with whom secondnameplaceholder had a particularly good musical rapport)[1]:180 adopting the xenochrony process. The album contains one of secondnameplaceholder's most famous guitar "signature pieces", "Watermelon in Easter Hay".[28]:61[51]\n

The movie's tagline was "A movie about people who do stuff that is not normal".[52] The 2 hour and 40 minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in New York around Halloween 1977, with a band featuring keyboardist Tommy Mars and percussionist Ed Mann (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist Adrian Belew. It also contained several extraordinary sequences of clay animation by Bruce Bickford who had earlier provided animation sequences to secondnameplaceholder for a 1974 TV special (which became available on the 1982 video The Dub Room Special).[9]:282 The movie did not do well in theatrical distribution,[53] but won the Premier Grand Prix at the First International Music Festival in Paris in 1981.[9]:282\n

The movie's tagline was "A movie about people who do stuff that is not normal".[52] The 2 hour and 40 minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in New York around Halloween 1977, with a band featuring keyboardist Tommy Mars and percussionist Ed Mann (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist Adrian Belew. It also contained several extraordinary sequences of clay animation by Bruce Bickford who had earlier provided animation sequences to secondnameplaceholder for a 1974 TV special (which became available on the 1982 video The Dub Room Special).[9]:282 The movie did not do well in theatrical distribution,[53] but won the Premier Grand Prix at the First International Music Festival in Paris in 1981.[9]:282\n

He was an actor or voice artist in episodes of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre,[54] Miami Vice[9]:343 and The Ren & Stimpy Show.[54] A voice part in The Simpsons never materialized, to creator Matt Groening's disappointment (Groening was a neighbor of secondnameplaceholder and a lifelong fan).[55]\n

Boulez Conducts secondnameplaceholder: The Perfect Stranger contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by celebrated conductor, composer and pianist Pierre Boulez (who was listed as an influence on Freak Out!), and performed by his Ensemble InterContemporain. These were juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, secondnameplaceholder was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision.[28]:73 The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, sampled.\n

Parts are also found on You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, volumes 4 and 6. Recordings from this tour also appear on the 2006 album Trance-Fusion.\n

The disease had been developing unnoticed for years and was considered inoperable.[73] After the diagnosis, secondnameplaceholder devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and Synclavier works. Shortly before his death in 1993 he completed Civilization Phaze III, a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.[9]:374–375[nb 9]\n

Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material.[9]:369 secondnameplaceholder also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year.[9]:369 secondnameplaceholder also performed in 1991 in Prague, claiming that "was the first time that he had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".[75][76]\n

At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture", and the final "G-Spot Tornado" as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor Peter Rundel). secondnameplaceholder received a 20-minute ovation.[9]:371 G-Spot Tornado was performed with Canadian dancer Louise Lecavalier. It was secondnameplaceholder's last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating".[9]:371 Recordings from the concerts appeared on The Yellow Shark (1993), secondnameplaceholder's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous Everything Is Healing Nicely (1999).\n

The disease had been developing unnoticed for years and was considered inoperable.[73] After the diagnosis, secondnameplaceholder devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and Synclavier works. Shortly before his death in 1993 he completed Civilization Phaze III, a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.[9]:374–375[nb 9]\n

Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material.[9]:369 secondnameplaceholder also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year.[9]:369 secondnameplaceholder also performed in 1991 in Prague, claiming that "was the first time that he had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".[75][76]\n

At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture", and the final "G-Spot Tornado" as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor Peter Rundel). secondnameplaceholder received a 20-minute ovation.[9]:371 G-Spot Tornado was performed with Canadian dancer Louise Lecavalier. It was secondnameplaceholder's last professional public appearance as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating".[9]:371 Recordings from the concerts appeared on The Yellow Shark (1993), secondnameplaceholder's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous Everything Is Healing Nicely (1999).\n

She won the competition with her song, "En ledig dag", leading to a television appearance on Hylands Hörna on Dagen H; as a result, she was signed by EMI, and in turn was signed by Stig Anderson's record label, Polar Music, after years of releasing several singles and an album, firstnameplaceholder under the earlier record label. Although she had moderate success in Sweden, as she was a contestant for Melodifestivalen 1969 with her song "Härlig är vår jord", she did not reach international fame until she joined ABBA, which has sold over 150 million albums and singles worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music acts in history. After the break-up of ABBA, she continued an international solo singing career with mixed success, releasing the albums Something's Going On (1982) and Shine (1984); the latter being her last international album. In 1996, secondnameplaceholder recorded her final album in Swedish, Djupa andetag (Deep Breaths), released by Anderson Records, before retiring from music.\n

The following year she was engaged to Swedish pianist Benny Andersson, also a member of ABBA, until they married in 1978. The couple separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981. In 1992, secondnameplaceholder married Prince Heinrich Ruzzo of Reuss, Count of Plauen, who was a prince of the former sovereign House of Reuss; since then she has held the titles of Princess Reuss and Countess of Plauen with the style of Her Serene Highness. Heinrich Ruzzo died of lymphoma in October 1999, leaving her the titles of Dowager Princess and Countess. She currently resides in Zermatt, Switzerland, sharing a home since 2008 with her British partner, Henry Smith, 5th Viscount Hambleden.\n

She showed musical talent at a very early age from her earliest school years. On firstnameplaceholderys, she was often asked by her teacher to sing in front of the class and soon became known in school and in the neighbourhood for her beautiful voice. Although her grandmother encouraged her to sing (according to secondnameplaceholder herself), she never attended any of her performances. Her grandmother died shortly before ABBA formed and therefore never witnessed the success of the group.\n

Subsequently, her relationship with Andersson, and friendship with Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog led to the formation of ABBA. In 1972, after five years with EMI Sweden, secondnameplaceholder changed record companies and moved to the Polar Music label. She recorded the single "Man vill ju leva lite dessemellan" ("One wants to live a little from time to time"), which became her second No. 1 hit in the Swedish charts.\n

William Cooper had a similar opinion in AllMusic: "firstnameplaceholder escapes the creative limitations of being a member of one of the world's most popular groups on this solid and often riveting album". Swedish Television SVT documented this historical event by filming the whole recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with firstnameplaceholder and Phil, Björn and Benny, as well as all the musicians involved with the album. Owing to the success of the album (selling 1.5 million copies worldwide),[4] and its lead single, firstnameplaceholder was voted "Best Female Artist Of The Year" 1982, by the readers of Sweden's biggest evening paper Aftonbladet, receiving the Swedish Music Award Price Rockbjörnen.\n

This album was recorded at Studios De La Grande Armée in Paris, France and produced by Steve Lillywhite, known for his work with artists like Peter Gabriel, U2, the Rolling Stones, Morrissey and Kirsty MacColl amongst others. Lillywhite was only 29 when this album was recorded and he gave firstnameplaceholder a very experimental sound and managed to create a relaxed atmosphere in the studio. The album had much less success than hoped, though it reached the Top 20 in many European countries, No. 6 in Sweden being its highest position.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In 1987, firstnameplaceholder was in the choir for the recording of her former husband Benny Andersson's song "Klinga Mina Klockor". Also in 1987, secondnameplaceholder recorded the single "Så Länge Vi Har Varann" ("As Long As We Have Each Other") with the Swedish pop group Ratata, one of secondnameplaceholder's favourites. She was contacted by singer Mauro Scocco, who mentioned that he had a song suitable for a duet. After hearing it, secondnameplaceholder accepted immediately.[17] The song achieved great success in Sweden, and was also recorded in English under the title of "As long as I have you". An English-language video of the song was produced, although an Australian release of this song on Festival Records in January 1998 was eventually shelved.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 1990, secondnameplaceholder became a member of the committee of the Swedish environmental organization Det Naturliga Steget (The Natural Step). The organization wanted a "famous face" to help them reach the public, and in 1991 she became chairwoman for the organization Artister För Miljö (Artists For The Environment). In 1992, secondnameplaceholder founded her Children and Environment Foundation which runs Summer Camps for underprivileged children.[18]  Also in 1992, secondnameplaceholder performed live at the Stockholm Water Festival at the Kings Castle and released the environmental charity single with her cover of Julian Lennon's song "Saltwater". All the royalties from this single went to charity. In 1993, on Queen Silvia's 50th birthday, firstnameplaceholder was asked to perform "Dancing Queen" on stage, as performed by ABBA when the king and queen married in 1976. firstnameplaceholder contacted The Real Group and together they performed the song at the Stockholm Opera House in front of the king and queen. The Swedish prime minister at the time, Ingvar Carlsson, also present that night, said it was an ingenious step to do "Dancing Queen" a cappella. This performance was filmed by Swedish TV and can be seen in firstnameplaceholder - The DVD.\n
 In 1996, secondnameplaceholder recorded her Swedish language album Djupa andetag (Deep Breaths). It was a long-awaited album as 12 years had passed since Shine was released. The album attracted overall relatively positive reviews and was a success in Sweden where it reached No. 1 on the album chart. firstnameplaceholder did many TV appearances in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland to promote the album. Djupa andetag was one of the first Swedish albums to be released as a combined audio-video CD-ROM, including interviews with secondnameplaceholder, footage from the making of the album, as well as promotional videos. Despite the fact that Djupa andetag was officially only released in Scandinavia and the songs were entirely sung in Swedish, a remix album of the single tracks "Även en blomma", "Alla Mina Bästa År" (a duet with Roxette's Marie Fredriksson) and "Ögonen" was released in Germany in 1998, entitled firstnameplaceholder - The Mixes. Despite the success of the album, none of these singles made a big impression on the Swedish charts. A one-hour documentary about the making of this album, both in the studio and from firstnameplaceholder's home in Mallorca, Spain, can be seen in firstnameplaceholder - The DVD. A follow-up album with producer Anders Glenmark was reportedly in the works, but was shelved due to the death of firstnameplaceholder's daughter in 1998. secondnameplaceholder dedicated the song "Chemistry Tonight" (co-written by Kirsty MacColl) to the songwriter after MacColl's death in 2000.\n

"Barcarolle" is only available on the Japanese edition of Giordano's album Rosso Amore and "The Sun Will Shine Again" can be found on Jon Lord's album Beyond The Notes (although a limited-promotional single had been made available). Lord and secondnameplaceholder made several TV appearances in Germany performing the song, on shows like The Sunday Night Classics and The Golden Henne Gala. secondnameplaceholder also joined Lord on stage singing the song during his European autumn tour in 2004. During this tour, she also performed "In the Bleak Midwinter", a performance of which can be found on social media.\n

All four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did the singer Cher and British comedian Rik Mayall amongst others. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release on the Universal Music label. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split in 1982 although they each filmed their appearances separately. Also in 2004, secondnameplaceholder appeared with former bandmates Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus in London at the fifth anniversary performance of Mamma Mia!, the musical based on ABBA songs. In 2008, she joined all three of her former ABBA colleagues at the Swedish premiere of Mamma Mia! at the arena Cirkus in Stockholm.\n firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was an American hip hop group, consisting of Texas record producer DJ Premier and Massachusetts rapper Guru.[1] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was at its height from 1989 to 2003, and are considered one of the best MC-and-producer duos in hip hop history.[2][3] They are recognized for being one of the pioneers of jazz rap.[3] Some of their top hits include "Mass Appeal", "Take It Personal", "Moment of Truth" and "Above The Clouds".[4]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Robert William firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (4 April 1952 – 6 February 2011) was a Northern Irish musician and songwriter. Over the course of his career he played in various groups and performed an eclectic range of music including blues, hard rock, heavy metal, and jazz fusion.\n

 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swathe of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their "classical" influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated medieval, baroque, and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal experiences but from philosophy and the works of François Rabelais and R. D. Laing. In 2015 they were recognised with the lifetime achievement award at the Progressive Music Awards.[3]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    firstnameplaceholder Washington secondnameplaceholder (born March 22, 1943)[3] is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter.

 By the mid-to-late 1970s, as he recorded for Warner Bros. Records, a whole new audience began to discover secondnameplaceholder. With the 1976 release Breezin', secondnameplaceholder sang a lead vocal on the track "This Masquerade" (notable also for the lush, romantic piano intro and solo by Jorge Dalto), which became a huge pop hit and won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. (He had sung vocals infrequently on albums earlier in his career, notably his rendition of "Here Comes the Sun" on the Other Side of Abbey Road album.) The rest of the album is instrumental, including his rendition of the 1975 Jose Feliciano composition "Affirmation".\n

                  During the same year, 1976, the top selling album 'Breezin' was released on the Warner Brothers label featuring the Bobby Womack penned title track and the Leon Russell penned This Masquerade which is now a jazz standard.  Both tracks won Grammy awards that year and the LP put secondnameplaceholder into the musical limelight both in the US and in Europe.  Ironically, secondnameplaceholder had been discouraged up until this time, from using his singing skills, mainly as the company decision makers felt he wasn't competent enough vocally, and he should stick to playing the guitar.  It was here that he clearly proved them wrong.\n

Sometimes called "the quiet Beatle", secondnameplaceholder embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.[2] Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two secondnameplaceholder compositions. His songs for the group include "Taxman", "Within You Without You", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something".\n
                          secondnameplaceholder's earliest musical influences included firstnameplaceholder Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, secondnameplaceholder released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, "My Sweet Lord", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, secondnameplaceholder produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978.\n

The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas.[236] According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: "'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of secondnameplaceholder's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".[237]\n

 A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of secondnameplaceholder's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on Gone Troppo (1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" on ukulele in 1992.[240] Lavezzoli described secondnameplaceholder's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling it "yet another demonstration of secondnameplaceholder's unique slide approach".[241] secondnameplaceholder was an admirer of firstnameplaceholder Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "Free as a Bird".[242] He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the firstnameplaceholder Formby Appreciation Society.[243] secondnameplaceholder played bass guitar on a few tracks, including the Beatles songs "She Said She Said", "Golden Slumbers", "Birthday" and "Honey Pie".[244] He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "Faster", "Wake Up My Love" and "Bye Bye Love".[245]\n

According to Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone, "secondnameplaceholder's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky ..."[266]\n

There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together."[268] In his next fully Indian-styled song, "The Inner Light", secondnameplaceholder embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style he had used in "Love You To" and "Within You Without You".[269] Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: "It is a mark of secondnameplaceholder's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light'."[270]\n

He described secondnameplaceholder's two contributions to the LP, "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.[69]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou; 25 June 1963 – 25 December 2016) was an English singer, songwriter, record producer, and philanthropist who rose to fame as a member of the music duo Wham! and later embarked on a solo career.

Soon, his band was given the opportunity to record several secondnameplaceholder-penned singles, including "That Don't Change The Way I Feel About You" and "I Can't Go On Dying Like This" for the Houston-based D label. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and secondnameplaceholder continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day to make some extra cash.[19][20]\n

Woolsey convinced some of his Music Row (Nashville) connections to come to Texas and to listen to secondnameplaceholder and his band play. Impressed with the performance, but concerned that they could not market the Western Swing sound that the band featured, they left without a deal.\n

He was offered a job designing cattle pens and decided to take it. He gave the band notice that he was leaving, but after a discussion with his wife, she convinced him to give music one more year. Not long afterward, MCA signed secondnameplaceholder to a recording contract in February 1981. The initial deal was for one song. If the single did well, the label would then consider doing an album.[21] The Ace in the Hole band remained with secondnameplaceholder, performing as the backup and touring band for the now solo career for secondnameplaceholder.[20]\n

Performing at that rodeo has since become a mainstay throughout his career, making more than 20 appearances at the rodeo, and playing to a total of more than one million fans.\n

 secondnameplaceholder and his family were struck with tragedy when his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was killed in a one-car, alcohol-unrelated accident in 1986. She was riding in a Ford Mustang driven by Gregory Wilson Allen, 18, of Staples, Texas. Allen was subsequently charged with a class A misdemeanor for vehicular homicide. Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin, said, "The responding trooper determined the cause of accident to be excessive speed and that the car did not negotiate the turn properly. Jenifer was riding in the front passenger seat, and none of the four occupants was wearing seat belts at the time.[25] When the vehicle flipped over onto its passenger's side, Jenifer was partially ejected, killing her on impact.[25][26] The incident caused secondnameplaceholder to greatly limit his contact with the media. He stopped doing interviews for many years after the accident, as his family and he did not wish to discuss Jenifer's death.[27]\n

The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, "Autumn Leaves" by Jacques Prévert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, "Comme un oiseau qui s'envole", which replaced "All on a Summers Night"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single "Do or Die".  In the North American club scene, Fame was a hit album and the "Do or Die"/"Pride"/"Fame" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD.[43] secondnameplaceholder's live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called "Queen of the Gay Discos."[5]\n

The album features a re-recorded version "I'll Find My Way to You", which secondnameplaceholder released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which secondnameplaceholder had a role as a club singer, secondnameplaceholder also recorded a song called "Again and Again" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with secondnameplaceholder on the track "Suffer". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.[44]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    With anti-disco sentiment spreading, and with the aid of the Compass Point All Stars, secondnameplaceholder transitioned into new wave music with the 1980 release of Warm Leatherette. The album included covers of songs by The Normal ("Warm Leatherette"), The Pretenders ("Private Life"), Roxy Music ("Love Is the Drug"), Smokey Robinson ("The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game"), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers ("Breakdown") and Jacques Higelin ("Pars"). Sly Dunbar revealed that the title track was also the first to be recorded with secondnameplaceholder.[45][46] Tom Petty wrote the lyrics to "Breakdown", and he also wrote the third verse of secondnameplaceholder's reinterpretation.[47] The album included one song co-written by secondnameplaceholder, "A Rolling Stone". Originally, "Pull Up to the Bumper" was to be included on the album, but its R&B sound did not fit with the rest of the material.[48] By 1981, she had begun collaborating with photographer and graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude, with whom she also had a relationship.[49] An extended version of "Private Life" was released as a single, with a cover of the Joy Division song "She's Lost Control", a non-album track, as the B-side.\n

Three songs were co-written by secondnameplaceholder: "Feel Up", "Art Groupie" and "Pull Up to the Bumper". Sting wrote "Demolition Man"; he later recorded it with The Police on the album Ghost in the Machine. "I've Done It Again" was written by Marianne Faithfull. The strong rhythm featured on Nightclubbing was produced by Compass Point All Stars, including Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou, Mikey Chung, Uziah "Sticky" Thompson and Barry Reynolds. The album entered in the Top 5 in four countries, and became secondnameplaceholder's highest-ranking record on the US Billboard mainstream albums and R&B charts.\n

While promoting the album, secondnameplaceholder slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making secondnameplaceholder feel she was being ignored.[53]\n

Inside Story was the first album secondnameplaceholder produced, which resulted in heated disputes with Rodgers. Musically, the album was more accessible than her previous albums with the Compass Point All Stars, and explored different styles of pop music, with undertones of jazz, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. All songs on the album were written by secondnameplaceholder and Bruce Woolley. Richard Bernstein teamed up with secondnameplaceholder again to provide the album's artwork. Inside Story made the top 40 in several European countries. The album was secondnameplaceholder's last entry to date on US Billboard 200 albums chart. The same year, secondnameplaceholder starred as Katrina, an Egyptian queen vampire in the vampire film Vamp. For her work in the film, secondnameplaceholder was awarded a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n

In 1952, he divorced Sheppard and married singer Billie Jean Horton. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism. On New Year's Day 1953, he suffered from heart failure and died suddenly at the age of 29 in Oak Hill, West Virginia. Despite his relatively brief career, he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in country music. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, George Jones, George Strait, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. secondnameplaceholder was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

His mother stated that she bought it with money from selling peanuts, but many other prominent residents of the town claimed to have been the one who purchased the guitar for him. While living in Georgiana, secondnameplaceholder met Rufus "Tee-Tot" Payne, a street performer. Payne gave secondnameplaceholder guitar lessons in exchange for money or meals prepared by Lillie.[19][20] Payne's base musical style was blues.[21] Payne taught secondnameplaceholder chords, chord progressions, bass turns, and the musical style of accompaniment that he would use in most of his future songwriting. Later on, secondnameplaceholder recorded "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It", one of the songs that Payne taught him.[22] His musical style contained influences from Payne along with several other country influences, among them Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Roy Acuff.[23] In 1937, secondnameplaceholder got into a fight with his physical education teacher about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. Payne and secondnameplaceholder lost touch, though Payne also eventually moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939. secondnameplaceholder later credited him as his only teacher.[24]\n
 secondnameplaceholder signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released "Move It on Over"; considered an early example of rock and roll music, the song became a massive country hit. In 1948, he moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, and he joined the Louisiana Hayride, a radio show broadcast that propelled him into living rooms all over the Southeast appearing on weekend shows. secondnameplaceholder eventually started to host a show on KWKH and started touring across western Louisiana and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the weekly broadcast of the Hayride.[48] After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 Cliff Friend and Irving Mills song "Lovesick Blues",[49] made popular by Rex Griffin. secondnameplaceholder's version became a huge country hit; the song stayed at number one on the Billboard charts for four consecutive months,[50] crossing over to mainstream audiences and gaining secondnameplaceholder a place in the Grand Ole Opry.[51] On June 11, 1949, secondnameplaceholder made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where he became the first performer to receive six encores.[52] He brought together Bob McNett (guitar), Hillous Butrum (bass), Jerry Rivers (fiddle) and Don Helms (steel guitar) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys, earning an estimated $1,000 per show (equivalent to $10,900 in 2020) That year Audrey secondnameplaceholder gave birth to Randall firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Jr.).[53] During 1949, he joined the first European tour of the Grand Ole Opry, performing in military bases in England, Germany and the Azores.[54] secondnameplaceholder released seven hit songs after "Lovesick Blues", including "Wedding Bells",[49]  "Mind Your Own Business", "You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)", and "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It".[55]\n

He sang "Cold, Cold Heart", "Hey Good Lookin''", "Glory Bound Train" and "I Saw the Light" with other cast members, and a duet, "I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)" with Anita Carter.[67] That same year, secondnameplaceholder had a brief extramarital affair with dancer Bobbie Jett, with whom he fathered a daughter, Jett secondnameplaceholder.[68]\n

Around this time, he met Billie Jean Jones, a girlfriend of country singer Faron Young, at the Grand Ole Opry. As a girl, Jones had lived down the street from secondnameplaceholder when he was with the Louisiana Hayride, and now secondnameplaceholder began to visit her frequently in Shreveport, causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances.[69]\n

He returned to Shreveport, Louisiana, to perform on KWKH and WBAM shows and in the Louisiana Hayride, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but despite the efforts of his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor.[70] In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.[71]\n

Due to secondnameplaceholder's excesses, Fred Rose stopped working with him. By the end of 1952, secondnameplaceholder had started to suffer heart problems.[53] He met Horace "Toby" Marshall in Oklahoma City, who said that he was a doctor. Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery, and had been paroled and released from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1951. Among other fake titles, he said that he was a Doctor of Science. He purchased the DSC title for $25 from the Chicago School of Applied Science; in the diploma, he requested that the DSC be spelled out as "Doctor of Science and Psychology". Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed secondnameplaceholder with amphetamines, Seconal, chloral hydrate, and morphine, which made his heart problems worse.[72] His final concert was held in Austin, Texas, at the Skyline Club on December 19.[73]\n

It was her second marriage and his first. Their son, Randall firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (now known as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Jr.), was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage was always turbulent and rapidly disintegrated, and secondnameplaceholder developed serious problems with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his spina bifida occulta.[10] The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.[74] In June 1952, secondnameplaceholder moved in with his mother, even as he released numerous hit songs such as "Half as Much" in April, "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)" in July, "You Win Again" in September, and "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive" in November. His substance abuse problems continued to spiral out of control as he moved to Nashville and officially divorced Sheppard.[75] A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter, Jett secondnameplaceholder, who was born five days after secondnameplaceholder died. His mother adopted Jett, who was made a ward of the state and then adopted by another couple after her grandmother died. Jett did not learn that she was secondnameplaceholder's daughter until the early 1980s.[76]\n

His first wife and his mother were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid, and they pursued the matter for years. secondnameplaceholder had also married Sheppard before her divorce was final, on the 10th day of a required 60-day reconciliation period.[78]\n

Eisenhower. According to singer Jo Stafford, secondnameplaceholder sent Eisenhower a birthday telegram on October 14, informing him that he considered it a personal honor to endorse a military figure to lead the nation in its coming future. Eisenhower was sworn in as president 19 days after secondnameplaceholder's death.[79]\n

A friend of the family denied his claims, but singer Billy Walker remembered that secondnameplaceholder mentioned to him the presence of men in the house being led upstairs.[80]\n Herbert Jeffrey secondnameplaceholder (born April 12, 1940) is an American pianist, keyboardist, bandleader, composer, and actor.[2] secondnameplaceholder started his career with Donald Byrd. He shortly thereafter joined the Miles Davis Quintet, where he helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the post-bop sound. In the 1970s, secondnameplaceholder experimented with jazz fusion, funk, and electro styles.\n

Originally from Mississippi, he moved to Chicago in adulthood and became successful, forming a rivalry with fellow bluesman Muddy Waters. With a booming voice and imposing physical presence, he is one of the best-known Chicago blues artists.\n
 The musician and critic Cub Koda noted, "no one could match firstnameplaceholder' secondnameplaceholder for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits."[1] Producer Sam Phillips recalled, "When I heard firstnameplaceholder' secondnameplaceholder, I said, 'This is for me.

Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he claims, "evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing."[408] Stating that he "was inspired by blues rock rather than metal," Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a "melodic player."[409] Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore,[410] which he claims is in contrast to Smith's "rhythmic" sound.[411]\n

Adrian Smith commented, "Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns."[416]\n

The group left Motown for Epic Records in early 1976, with the exception of Jermaine, who was replaced by Randy. At Epic, they released four studio albums and one live album between 1976 and 1981, including the successful albums Destiny (1978) and Triumph (1980) and the singles "Enjoy Yourself", "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)", and "Can You Feel It".\n

In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on the Motown 2secondnameplaceholder: Yesterday, Today, Forever TV special. They released the Victory album the following year, followed by an extensive tour which also featured songs from Michael's solo albums. After the Victory tour, Michael and Marlon firstnameplaceholder left the group. The remaining four released the poorly received 2300 firstnameplaceholder Street album in 1989 before being dropped from their label. In 2001, the firstnameplaceholders reunited on Michael's 30th Anniversary Celebration TV special. The four eldest of the brothers embarked on their Unity Tour in 2012 following Michael's death, and they planned several major performances for 2017.[secondnameplaceholder][6]\n

They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Two of the band's recordings ("ABC" and "I Want You Back") are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's secondnameplaceholder00 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and, alongside "I'll Be There", were also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n

In early 2009, the four elder brothers began filming a reality show to make their attempt on reuniting the band, later debuting in December 2009 as The firstnameplaceholders: A Family Dynasty.[16] During the middle of the project, Michael had announced his concert comeback in London was scheduled on July 13, 2009. Michael died that same year on June 2secondnameplaceholder, putting efforts on halt.\n

The song did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100, but charted at number nineteen on Billboards Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks.[18] "This Is It" returned the firstnameplaceholders to the chart. The surviving members of the firstnameplaceholders were in talks of planning a reunion concert tour (which was to serve as a tribute to Michael) for 2010, and were in talks in working on their first new studio album in over 20 years.[16][19] However, neither plan was put into action.\n

In 2011, Jackie firstnameplaceholder released a solo single to iTunes, while Jermaine released his first solo album in 21 years, I Wish U Love. Following the release of one solo album, Marlon quit the music business in 1989 and invested in real estate. Randy has not been active in the industry since he disbanded the group Randy & the Gypsys in 1991.\n
 In August 2011, there appeared to be a discord between the brothers concerning a tribute concert dedicated to Michael. While Jackie, Tito and Marlon were present alongside mother Katherine and sister La Toya for a tribute concert in Cardiff at the Millennium Stadium for a press conference concerning the tour, a couple of days after the press conference, both Randy and Jermaine issued a statement denouncing the tribute tour as the date of it occurred around the time of Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial in relation to Michael's death. The show carried on with Jackie, Tito and Marlon performing without Jermaine. In April 2012, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon announced that they would reunite for several United States concerts for their Unity Tour. Thirty-eight dates were announced, however, eleven shows in the U.S. were canceled. The tour started at Casino Rama in Orillia, Ontario, Canada on June 20, 2012.[20] Thirty-two additional dates were eventually added, and the tour ended on July 27, 2013 in Atlantic City, United States.\n

Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".[1]\n

He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings.  Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "secondnameplaceholder pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but secondnameplaceholder turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."[3]\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The scheduled release date for Axis was almost delayed when secondnameplaceholder lost the master tape of side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi.[171] With the deadline looming, secondnameplaceholder, Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of "If 6 Was 9". Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled.[172] During the verses, secondnameplaceholder doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals.[173] secondnameplaceholder voiced his disappointment about having re-mixed the album so quickly, and he felt that it could have been better had they been given more time.[171]\n
 secondnameplaceholder's performance included a rendition of the US national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner", with copious feedback, distortion, and sustain to imitate the sounds made by rockets and bombs.[221] Contemporary political pundits described his interpretation as a statement against the Vietnam War. Three weeks later secondnameplaceholder said: "We're all Americans ... it was like 'Go America!'... We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see."[222] Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film, Woodstock, his guitar-driven version would become part of the sixties Zeitgeist.[223] Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the New York Post wrote: "It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock, and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties."[222] Images of the performance showing secondnameplaceholder wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket with fringe, a red head-scarf, and blue jeans are regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era.[224][nb 31] He played "Hey Joe" during the encore, concluding the 31⁄2-day festival. Upon leaving the stage, he collapsed from exhaustion.[223][nb 32] In 2011, the editors of Guitar World named his performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" the greatest performance of all time.[227]\n

They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP, which was produced by secondnameplaceholder.[235] The album includes the track "Machine Gun", which musicologist Andy Aledort described as the pinnacle of secondnameplaceholder's career, and "the premiere example of [his] unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist ... In this performance, firstnameplaceholder transcended the medium of rock music, and set an entirely new standard for the potential of electric guitar."[236] During the song's extended instrumental breaks, secondnameplaceholder created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare, including rockets, bombs, and diving planes.[237]\n

He didn't move until it was time for the show."[241] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for "Foxy Lady". He then began playing "Earth Blues" before telling the audience: "That's what happens when earth fucks with space".[241] Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage.[242] Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given secondnameplaceholder LSD before the performance.[243] Miles believed that Jeffery gave secondnameplaceholder the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup.[242] Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.[244]\n James William secondnameplaceholder (born December 25, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter,[10] musician, author, actor, and businessman.

Most of his best known singles were covers of songs by other artists, though he composed a number of his own songs for most of his albums as well, often in conjunction with songwriting partner Chris Stainton.[1]\n
 His first album featured a recording of the Beatles' "With a Little Help from My Friends", which brought him to near instant stardom.  The song reached number one in the UK in 1968, became a staple of his many live shows, and became known to later generations as the theme song for the TV series The Wonder Years.  He continued his successes with his his second album, which included a second Beatles cover, "She Came In Through the Bathroom Window".  Capitalizing on his success, a hastily thrown together 1970 U.S. tour led to the live double-album Mad Dogs & Englishmen, which featured an all-star band organized by Leon Russell.

Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, secondnameplaceholder helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions  and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, secondnameplaceholder's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension, as exemplified on his most acclaimed albums A Love Supreme (1965) and Ascension (1966). He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history. He received numerous posthumous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize in 2007, and was canonized by the African Orthodox Church.[2] His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice secondnameplaceholder.  The couple had three children: firstnameplaceholder Jr. (1964–1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), also a saxophonist.[3][4][5]\n

From then on, the "Classic Quartet", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. secondnameplaceholder was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage secondnameplaceholder heavily favored continually reworking his "standards": "Impressions", "My Favorite Things", and "I Want to Talk About You".\n
 The criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected secondnameplaceholder. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of secondnameplaceholder, 1962, which featured a blistering version of Harold Arlen's "Out of This World") were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with Duke Ellington and singer firstnameplaceholderny Hartman, a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album Ballads (recorded 1961–62) is emblematic of secondnameplaceholder's versatility, as the quartet shed new light on old-fashioned standards such as "It's Easy to Remember". Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance "standards" and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the Impressions (recorded 1961–63), Live at Birdland and Newport '63 (both recorded 1963). Impressions consists of two extended jams including the title track along with "Dear Old Stockholm", "After the Rain" and a blues. secondnameplaceholder later said he enjoyed having a "balanced catalogue."[47]\n

A culmination of much of secondnameplaceholder's work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of secondnameplaceholder's composing and playing from this point onwards—as can be seen from album titles such as Ascension, Om and Meditations. The fourth movement of A Love Supreme, "Psalm", is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by secondnameplaceholder, and printed in the album's liner notes. secondnameplaceholder plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at secondnameplaceholder's home in Dix Hills on Long Island.\n

He was listed on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Songwriters (at number 40) and the list of 100 Greatest Singers (at number 72).[8] His songs include "Proud Mary", "Bad Moon Rising", "Fortunate Son", "Green River", "Down on the Corner", "Who'll Stop the Rain", and "Centerfield".\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        After secondnameplaceholder's military service, the Golliwogs resumed playing, releasing an album in late 1967. In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their eponymous debut album and also had their first hit single, "Susie Q". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with "Proud Mary" and the album Bayou Country.\n
 secondnameplaceholder, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band.[16] These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. secondnameplaceholder, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, Mardi Gras, released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit "Sweet Hitch-Hiker", and "Someday Never Comes", which  made it into the Billboard Top 20.\n
                                                                                                                                                           Cook and Clifford told secondnameplaceholder that the fans would not accept Mardi Gras as a CCR LP, but secondnameplaceholder told them, "My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs." According to the two bandmates, secondnameplaceholder gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or \nsecondnameplaceholder would quit immediately.[17] They accepted secondnameplaceholder's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status. It did, however, generate weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Even early in his career, “secondnameplaceholder’s attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. …[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although firstnameplaceholder struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.” [18] “Not in my band,” he writes in his memoir, Fortunate Son. “You dare not be stoned playing music around me.... When you’re working, you’re supposed to be working.”[19]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As CCR was coming to an end, secondnameplaceholder began working on a solo album of country and western covers, on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, secondnameplaceholder elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers—a band of which he was the only member.[20]\n
                                                                                            The eponymous The Blue Ridge Rangers was released in 1973; it spun off the top-20 hit "Jambalaya", as well as a lesser hit in "Hearts of Stone".[20] secondnameplaceholder, still using "The Blue Ridge Rangers" name, then released a self-penned rock-and-roll single: "You Don't Owe Me" b/w "Back in the Hills" (Fantasy F-710).  It was a commercial flop, failing to make the Hot 100 in the U.S., though "You Don't Owe Me" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching number 79.  secondnameplaceholder thereafter abandoned the "Blue Ridge Rangers" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name.[20] In early 1974, secondnameplaceholder released "Comin' Down The Road"—backed with the instrumental "Ricochet".\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          His first official solo album, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, was released in 1975.[20] Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded "Rockin' All Over the World", a number-27 hit for secondnameplaceholder in the United States. In 1977, British boogie rockers Status Quo recorded their version of "Rockin' All Over the World", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous.[20] Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 Live Aid concert.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In 1976, secondnameplaceholder finished an album called Hoodoo.[20] A single, "You Got the Magic" backed with "Evil Thing", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by Asylum Records a few weeks before its scheduled release, and secondnameplaceholder agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. secondnameplaceholder told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for Hoodoo sometime in the 1980s.[21]\n                                                                firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (August 22, 1912[1] or 1917[4][5] – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie. Hooker was ranked 35 in Rolling Stone's 2015 list of 100 greatest guitarists.[6]\n
 Some of his best known songs include "Boogie Chillen'" (1948), "Crawling King Snake" (1949), "Dimples" (1956), "Boom Boom" (1962), and "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" (1966). Several of his later albums, including The Healer (1989), Mr. Lucky (1991), Chill Out (1995), and Don't Look Back (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and UK. The Healer (for the song "I'm In The Mood") and Chill Out (for the album) both earned him Grammy wins[7][8] as well as Don't Look Back, which went on to earn him a double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van Morrison).[9]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    firstnameplaceholder Winston Ono secondnameplaceholder[nb 1] (born firstnameplaceholder Winston secondnameplaceholder; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician and peace activist[2] who achieved worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.[3] In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, secondnameplaceholder continued his career as a solo artist and as Ono's collaborator.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Born in Liverpool, secondnameplaceholder became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. secondnameplaceholder was characterised for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.  In the mid-1960s, he had two books published: In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with 1967's "All You Need Is Love", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                From 1968 to 1972, secondnameplaceholder produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top 10 singles  "Give Peace a Chance", "Instant Karma!", "Imagine" and "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)". In 1969, he held the two week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-Ins for Peace. After moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, secondnameplaceholder disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean and, in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building by a Beatles fan, Mark David Chapman, three weeks after the album's release.\n

Double Fantasy, his best-selling album, won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1982, secondnameplaceholder was honoured with the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, secondnameplaceholder was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and thirty-eighth greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).\n

This gesture had no effect on his MBE status, which could not be renounced.[98] The medal, together with secondnameplaceholder's letter, is held at the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood.[99]\n
                                                                                                                                                                       secondnameplaceholder left the Beatles in September 1969,[100] but agreed not to inform the media while the group renegotiated their recording contract. He was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. secondnameplaceholder's reaction was, "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!"[101] He later wrote, "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that."[102] In a December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record."[103] secondnameplaceholder also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison and Starr "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul ... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?"[104]\n
 Eager for a major commercial success, secondnameplaceholder adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971).[117] Rolling Stone reported that "it contains a substantial portion of good music" but warned of the possibility that "his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant".[118] The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements,[119] while the song "How Do You Sleep?" was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics on Ram that secondnameplaceholder felt, and McCartney later confirmed,[120] were directed at him and Ono.[121][nb 3] In "Jealous Guy", secondnameplaceholder addressed his demeaning treatment of women, acknowledging that his past behaviour was the result of long-held insecurity.[123] In gratitude for his guitar contributions to Imagine, secondnameplaceholder initially agreed to perform at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York.[124] Harrison refused to allow Ono to participate at the concerts, however, which resulted in the couple having a heated argument and secondnameplaceholder pulling out of the event.[125]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Iain David McGeachy OBE (11 September 1948 – 29 January 2009), known professionally as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, was a British singer-songwriter and guitarist. Over a 40-year career, he released 23 studio albums, and received frequent critical acclaim. The Times described him as "an electrifying guitarist and singer whose music blurred the boundaries between folk, jazz, rock and blues".[2]\n

By the 1970s he had begun incorporating jazz and rock into his sound on albums such as Solid Air (1973) and One World (1977), as well as experimenting with guitar effects and tape delay machines such as Echoplex.[3] He struggled with substance abuse and domestic problems throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though he continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as Phil Collins and Lee "Scratch" Perry. He remained active until his death in 2009.\n

This sound was first apparent on Stormbringer! released in February 1970.\n

Their second duo album, The Road to Ruin, was released in November 1970. Island Records felt that it would be more successful to market secondnameplaceholder as a solo act and this was how subsequent albums were produced, although Beverley continued to make appearances as a backing singer as well as continuing as a solo artist herself.[2]\n

In  February 1973, secondnameplaceholder released the album Solid Air, the title song a tribute to the singer-songwriter Nick Drake, a close friend and label-mate who would die in 1974 from an overdose of antidepressants. In 2009, a double CD Deluxe edition of Solid Air was released featuring unreleased songs and out-takes, and sleeve notes by Record Collector's Daryl Easlea. On Bless the Weather and on Solid Air secondnameplaceholder collaborated with jazz bassist Danny Thompson, with whom he proceeded to have a musical partnership which continued until his death.\n

In 1975, he followed this with Sunday's Child, a more song-based collection that includes "My Baby Girl" and "Spencer the Rover", which are references to his young family. secondnameplaceholder subsequently described this period as 'very happy'. In September 1975, he released a live album, Live at Leeds — secondnameplaceholder had been unable to persuade Island to release the record, and resorted to selling individually signed copies by mail from his home in Hastings. Live at Leeds features Danny Thompson and drummer firstnameplaceholder Stevens. In 2010, a 2CD Deluxe version of Live at Leeds was released, and it was discovered that not all of the songs on the original album were from the Leeds concert. After releasing Live at Leeds, secondnameplaceholder took a sabbatical, including a visit to Jamaica, spending time with reggae producer Lee "Scratch" Perry.\n

Small Hours was recorded outside; the microphones picked up ambient sounds, such as geese from a nearby lake.[5] In 1978, he played guitar on the album Harmony of the Spheres by Neil Ardley.\n
 secondnameplaceholder's marriage broke down at the end of the 1970s and "firstnameplaceholder hit the self destruct button"[15] (although other biographers, including The Times obituary writer, attribute the break-up of his marriage to his already being addicted to drink and drugs).[2] In her autobiography, Beverley also alleges protracted domestic violence.[16]  Out of this period, described by secondnameplaceholder as "a very dark period in my life",[17] came the album Grace and Danger. Released in October 1980, the album had been held up for a year by Chris Blackwell. He was a close friend of firstnameplaceholder and Beverley, and found the album too openly disturbing to release. Only after intense and sustained pressure from secondnameplaceholder did Blackwell agree to release the album. Commenting on that period, secondnameplaceholder said, "I was in a dreadful emotional state over that record. I was hardly in control of my own actions. The reason they finally released it was because I freaked: Please get it out! I don't give a damn about how sad it makes you feel—it's what I'm about: the direct communication of emotion. Grace and Danger was very cathartic, and it really hurt."[17]\n

Some people keep diaries, I make records."[17] The album has since become one of his highest-regarded, prompting a deluxe double-disc issue in 2007, containing the original album remastered.\n

Following this incident she focused on her creative talent and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time.[24] By 9, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice.[25] At 11, she moved with her family to the city of Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook.[24][26] One unconventional teacher, Arthur Kratzmann, did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry; her first album includes a dedication to him.[27] In grade 12, she dropped out (she later continued with her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until she decided that she was getting too close to the criminal world.[24]\n

As her mother disapproved of its hillbilly associations,[28] she settled initially for the ukulele. Eventually she taught herself guitar from a Pete Seeger songbook.[29] Polio had weakened her left hand, so she devised alternative tunings to compensate; she later used these tunings to create nonstandard approaches to harmony and structure in her songwriting.[30]\n

Her first paid performance was on October 31, 1962, at a Saskatoon club that featured folk and jazz performers.[31][32] At 18, she widened her repertoire to include her favourite performers, such as Édith Piaf and Miles Davis. Although she never performed jazz herself in those days, secondnameplaceholder and her friends sought out gigs by jazz musicians. secondnameplaceholder said, "My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert, Hendricks and Ross albums." That album, The Hottest New Group in Jazz, was hard to find in Canada, she says. "So I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price. I considered that album to be my Beatles. I learned every song off of it, and I don't think there is another album anywhere—including my own—on which I know every note and word of every song."[33]\n

Here she felt disillusioned about the high priority given to technical skill over free-class creativity,[23] and felt out of step with the trend toward pure abstraction and the tendency to move into commercial art. After a year, at age 20, she dropped out of school, a decision that greatly displeased her parents, who could remember the Great Depression and valued education highly.[citation needed]\n

Around this time she took a $15-a-week job in a Calgary coffeehouse called The Depression Coffee House, "singing long tragic songs in a minor key". She sang at hootenannies and made appearances on some local TV and radio shows in Calgary.[31] In 1964, at the age of 20, she told her mother that she intended to be a folk singer in Toronto, and she left western Canada for the first time in her life, heading east for Ontario. On the three-day train ride there, secondnameplaceholder wrote her first song, "Day After Day". She stopped at the Mariposa Folk Festival to see Buffy Sainte-Marie, a Saskatchewan-born Cree folk singer who had inspired her. A year later, secondnameplaceholder too played Mariposa, her first gig for a major audience, and years later Sainte-Marie herself covered secondnameplaceholder's work.\n

Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking,[31] while she "worked in the women's wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent."[35] During this era, she lived in a rooming house, directly across the hall from poet Duke Redbird.[36] Without a lot of name recognition, secondnameplaceholder also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which secondnameplaceholder found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property and would no longer pass muster. She said she was told "'You can't sing that. That's my song.' And I named another one. 'You can't sing that. That's my song.' This is my introduction to territorial songs. I ran into it again in Toronto." She resolved to write her own songs.[37]\n

She later wrote, "[He] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed—fuel for last winter's occupants."[38]  In February 1965, she gave birth to a baby girl. Unable to provide for the baby, she placed her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, for adoption. The experience remained private for most of secondnameplaceholder's career, although she alluded to it in several songs, such as "Little Green", which she performed in the 1960s and recorded eventually for the 1971 album Blue. In "Chinese Cafe", from the 1982 album Wild Things Run Fast, secondnameplaceholder sang, "Your kids are coming up straight / My child's a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her." These lyrics did not receive wide attention at the time.\n

When she could not express herself to the person she wanted to talk to, she became attuned to the whole world, and she began to write personally.[42]\n

In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met New York City-born American folk singer Charles Scott "Chuck" secondnameplaceholder, from Michigan.  Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States.[43]\n

She said, "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies."[44]\n

The marriage and partnership of firstnameplaceholder and Chuck secondnameplaceholder ended with their divorce in early 1967, and she moved to New York City to follow her musical path as a solo artist. She played venues up and down the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style.\n

He took "Urge for Going" to the popular folk artist Judy Collins, but she was not interested in the song at the time, so Rush recorded it himself. Country singer George Hamilton IV heard Rush performing it and recorded a hit country version. Other artists who recorded secondnameplaceholder's songs in the early years were Buffy Sainte-Marie ("The Circle Game"), Dave Van Ronk ("Both Sides Now"), and eventually Judy Collins ("Both Sides Now", a top ten hit for her, and "Michael from Mountains", both included on her 1967 album Wildflowers). Collins also covered "Chelsea Morning", another recording that eclipsed secondnameplaceholder's own commercial success early on.\n

Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts, who, after being urged by Buffy Sainte-Marie, had first seen her play in a Greenwich Village coffee house.[50]  He had a close business association with David Geffen.[51] Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. Eventually she was signed to the Warners-affiliated Reprise label by talent scout Andy Wickham.[52] Crosby convinced Reprise to let secondnameplaceholder record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at that time, and his clout earned him a producer's credit in March 1968, when Reprise released her debut album, known either as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder or Song to a Seagull.\n

The tour helped create eager anticipation for secondnameplaceholder's second LP, Clouds, which was released in April 1969. This album contained secondnameplaceholder's own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists: "Chelsea Morning", "Both Sides, Now", and "Tin Angel". The covers of both LPs, including a self-portrait on Clouds, were designed and painted by secondnameplaceholder, a blending of her painting and music that she continued throughout her career.\n

The following month, Reprise released her third album, Ladies of the Canyon. secondnameplaceholder's sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of secondnameplaceholder's style in her most popular era. Her own version of "Woodstock", slower than the cover by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, was performed solo on a Wurlitzer electric piano. The album also included the already-familiar song "The Circle Game" and the environmental anthem "Big Yellow Taxi", with its now-famous line, "they paved paradise and put up a parking lot."\n

She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted "Top Female Performer" for 1970 by Melody Maker, a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of James Taylor's Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon album, secondnameplaceholder is credited with backup vocals on the track "You've Got a Friend". The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, Blue, released in June 1971. Comparing firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's talent to his own, David Crosby said, "By the time she did Blue, she was past me and rushing toward the horizon".[53]\n

The lushly produced "Carey" was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on secondnameplaceholder's voice and emotions ("All I Want", "A Case of You"), while others such as "Blue", "River" and "The Last Time I Saw Richard" were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, secondnameplaceholder later said of Blue, "I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup, ... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, but at the time of Blue, our pop stars never admitted these things."[54] In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in "California"). secondnameplaceholder later remarked, "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong."[24]\n

The album was released in October 1972 and immediately zoomed up the charts. She followed with the single, "You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio", which peaked at No. 25 in the Billboard charts in February 1973.[55]\n

The LP made secondnameplaceholder a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker "Raised on Robbery", which was released right before Christmas 1973, and "Help Me", which was released in March of the following year, and became secondnameplaceholder's only Top 10 single when it peaked at No. 7 in the first week of June. "Free Man in Paris" was another hit single and staple in her catalog.\n

Express as what she called her first real backing group. In February 1974, her tour with the L.A. Express began, and they received rave notices as they traveled across the United States and Canada during the next two months. A series of shows at L.A.'s Universal Amphitheater from August 14–17 were recorded for a live album. In November, secondnameplaceholder released that album, Miles of Aisles, a two-record set including all but two songs from the L.A. concerts (one selection each from the Berkeley Community Theatre, on March 2, and the L.A. Music Center, on March 4, were also included in the set). The live album slowly moved up to No. 2, matching Court and Spark's chart peak on Billboard. "Big Yellow Taxi", the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (she released another version of the song in 2007).\n

She won only the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.\n

The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide-ranging textures. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive "slaps".\n

Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the Roland VG-8 virtual guitar, a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded the pickup signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed secondnameplaceholder to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.[102]\n

In an era dominated by the stereotypical male rock star, she presented herself as "multidimensional and conflicted ... allow[ing] her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans".[105] secondnameplaceholder asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music. She has disclaimed the notion that she is a "feminist"; in a 2013 interview she rejected the label, stating, "I'm not a feminist. I don't want to get a posse against men. I'd rather go toe-to-toe; work it out."[106] David Shumway notes that secondnameplaceholder "became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full sense of that term.... Whatever secondnameplaceholder's stated views of feminism, what she represents more than any other performer of her era is the new prominence of women's perspectives in cultural and political life."[105]\n

I knew every word to Court and Spark; I worshipped her when I was in high school. Blue is amazing. I would have to say of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view."[119]\n
 Several artists have had success covering secondnameplaceholder's songs. Judy Collins's 1967 recording of "Both Sides, Now" reached No. 8 on Billboard charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists. (secondnameplaceholder's own recording did not see release until two years later, on her second album Clouds.) This is secondnameplaceholder's most-covered song by far, with over 1,200 versions recorded at latest count.[120] Hole also covered "Both Sides, Now" in 1991 on their debut album, Pretty on the Inside, retitling it "Clouds", with the lyrics altered by frontwoman Courtney Love. Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and Amy Grant in 1995 scored hits with covers of "Big Yellow Taxi", the third-most covered song in secondnameplaceholder's repertoire (with over 300 covers).[120] Recent releases of this song have been by Counting Crows in 2002 and Nena in 2007. Janet Jackson used a sample of the chorus of "Big Yellow Taxi" as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single "Got 'Til It's Gone", which also features rapper Q-Tip saying "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder never lies". "River", from secondnameplaceholder's album Blue became the second-most covered song of secondnameplaceholder's in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums.[120] Rap artists Kanye West and Mac Dre have also sampled secondnameplaceholder's vocals in their music. In addition, Annie Lennox has covered "Ladies of the Canyon" for the B-side of her 1995 hit "No More I Love You's". Mandy Moore covered "Help Me" in 2003. In 2004 singer George Michael covered her song "Edith and the Kingpin" for a radio show. "River" has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by Dianne Reeves (1999), James Taylor (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), Allison Crowe (2004), Rachael Yamagata (2004), Aimee Mann (2005), and Sarah McLachlan (2006). McLachlan also did a version of "Blue" in 1996, and Cat Power recorded a cover of "Blue" in 2008. Other secondnameplaceholder covers include the famous "Woodstock" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Eva Cassidy, and Matthews Southern Comfort; "This Flight Tonight" by Nazareth; and well-known versions of "A Case of You" by Tori Amos, Michelle Branch, Jane Monheit, Prince, Diana Krall, James Blake, and Ana Moura. A 40th anniversary version of "Woodstock" was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort). Fellow Canadian singer k.d. lang recorded two of secondnameplaceholder's songs ("A Case of You" and "Jericho") for her 2004 album Hymns of the 49th Parallel which is composed entirely of songs written by Canadian artists.\n

The song "Our House" by Graham Nash refers to Nash's two-year relationship with secondnameplaceholder at the time that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the Déjà Vu album. Led Zeppelin's "Going to California" was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's infatuation with secondnameplaceholder, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says "firstnameplaceholder" after the line "To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings". Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings secondnameplaceholder uses. The Sonic Youth song "Hey firstnameplaceholder" is named for secondnameplaceholder. Alanis Morissette also mentions secondnameplaceholder in one of her songs, "Your House". British folk singer Frank Turner mentions secondnameplaceholder in his song "Sunshine State". The Prince song "The Ballad of Dorothy Parker" contains the lyric – " 'Oh, my favorite song' she said – and it was firstnameplaceholder singing 'Help me I think I'm falling' ". "Lavender" by Marillion was partly influenced by "going through parks listening to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder", according to vocalist and lyricist Fish,[121] and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song "Montreal" from Sounds That Can't Be Made.[122] John Mayer makes reference to secondnameplaceholder and her Blue album in his song "Queen of California", from his 2012 album Born and Raised.

And Woodstock was the culmination of it." But "I was not a part of that," she explained in an interview. "I was not a part of the anti-war movement, either. I played in Fort Bragg.

In 2002, secondnameplaceholder was recognised with an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. secondnameplaceholder was appointed a CBE in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music.[14][15] She was nominated twice for induction in the 2018 and 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[16][17]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      For her debut album, The Kick Inside (1978), secondnameplaceholder was persuaded to use established session musicians instead of the KT secondnameplaceholder Band. She retained some of these even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.[39] Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and became her main drummer on subsequent albums.[40] The Kick Inside was released when secondnameplaceholder was 19, with some songs written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her debut single, but secondnameplaceholder, who already had a reputation for asserting herself in decisions about her work, insisted that it should be "Wuthering Heights".[26]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In the United Kingdom alone, The Kick Inside sold over a million copies.[41] "Wuthering Heights" topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit.[42] secondnameplaceholder became the first British woman to reach number one on the UK charts with a self-written song.[43] "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" made it onto the American Billboard Hot 100 where it reached number 85 in early 1979, and went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric.[44] According to Guinness World Records, secondnameplaceholder was the first female artist in pop history to have written every track on a million-selling debut album.[41]\n
                                                                                                                                                          Bob Mercer blamed secondnameplaceholder's lesser success in the United States on American radio formats, saying there were no outlets for secondnameplaceholder's visual presentation.[33] EMI capitalised on secondnameplaceholder's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME in 1982, secondnameplaceholder criticised the choice: "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body."[26] In late 1978, EMI persuaded secondnameplaceholder to quickly record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by secondnameplaceholder. While it gained high sales and spawned the hit single "Wow", it did not reach the success of The Kick Inside, reaching number six in the UK album charts. She went on to express dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling that it had needed more time.[45]\n
                                                                              secondnameplaceholder set up her own publishing company, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain control of her work. Members of her family, along with secondnameplaceholder herself, composed the board of directors.[26] Following the release of Lionheart, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour.[46] The Tour of Life began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. It was described by The Guardian as "an extraordinary, hydra-headed beast, combining music, dance, poetry, mime, burlesque, magic and theatre".[10] The show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake.[47] secondnameplaceholder was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design, costume design and hiring.[26] The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her need to dance as she sang, sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion a headset microphone; it was the first used by a rock performer since the Spotnicks used a rudimentary version in the early 1960s.[1][48]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw secondnameplaceholder's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "Army Dreamers".\n

Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.[60] Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position.[61]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, Hounds of Love, contains five "accessible" pop songs, including the four singles "Running Up that Hill", "Cloudbusting", "Hounds of Love", and "The Big Sky". "Running Up that Hill" reached number three in the UK charts and re-introduced secondnameplaceholder to American listeners, climbing to number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the album, The Ninth Wave, takes its name from Tennyson's poem, "Idylls of the King", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.[62]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The album earned secondnameplaceholder nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 BRIT Awards. In the same year, secondnameplaceholder and Peter Gabriel had a UK Top 10 hit with the duet "Don't Give Up" (Dolly Parton, Gabriel's original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down),[63] and EMI released her "greatest hits" album, The Whole Story. secondnameplaceholder provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on "Wuthering Heights", and recorded a new single, "Experiment IV", for inclusion on the compilation. Dawn French and Hugh Laurie were among those featured in the video for Experiment IV. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, secondnameplaceholder won the award for Best Female Solo Artist.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Released in 1989, The Sensual World was described by secondnameplaceholder herself as "her most honest, personal album".[64] One of the tracks, "Heads We're Dancing", inspired by her own black humour, is about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler. The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce's novel Ulysses.[65] The Sensual World went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number-two position.[66] Another single from the album, "This Woman's Work", was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on secondnameplaceholder's album The Sensual World.[67] The song reached number-eight in 2005 on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.[68]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    secondnameplaceholder provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's albums, including the hits "Games Without Frontiers" and "Don't Give Up", as well as "No Self-Control". Gabriel appeared on secondnameplaceholder's 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of Roy Harper's "Another Day". She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, "You", on his 1979 album, "The Unknown Soldier"; and "Once", the title track of his 1990 album. She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 Big Country album The Seer; the Midge Ure song "Sister and Brother" from his 1988 album Answers to Nothing; Go West's 1987 single "The King Is Dead"; and two songs with Prince – "Why Should I Love You?", from her 1993 album The Red Shoes, and "My Computer" from Prince's 1996 album Emancipation. In 1987, she sang a verse on the Beatles cover charity single "Let It Be" by Ferry Aid. She sang a line on the charity single "Spirit of the Forest" by Spirit of the Forest in 1989.\n

Stivell had appeared on The Sensual World. In 1991, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was invited to perform a cover of Elton John's 1972 song "Rocket Man" for the tribute album Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin.

 In 2016, Canadian news magazine Maclean's published an interview in which secondnameplaceholder was asked about the role of misogyny in the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. secondnameplaceholder pointed out that the UK, unlike the US, did have a female premier, Theresa May, who a few months earlier had become the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It quoted secondnameplaceholder as saying: "I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time ... It is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time."[224] In 2019, secondnameplaceholder published a clarifying statement on her website saying she did not support the Conservative Party. She wrote: "Over the years, I have avoided making political comments in interviews. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power ... I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power … it could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter which I want to make clear I am not".[224]\n                                                           Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge.

He also toured Africa, Europe, and Asia under the sponsorship of the US State Department with great success, earning the nickname "Ambassador Satch" and inspiring Dave Brubeck to compose his jazz musical The Real Ambassadors. By 1968, he was approaching 70 and his health began to give out. He suffered heart and kidney ailments that forced him to stop touring. He did not perform publicly at all in 1969 and spent most of the year recuperating at home. Meanwhile, his longtime manager Joe Glaser died. By the summer of 1970, his doctors pronounced him fit enough to resume live performances. He embarked on another world tour, but a heart attack forced him to take a break for two months.[79]\n

On various live records he's called "Louie" on stage, such as on the 1952 "Can Anyone Explain?" from the live album In Scandinavia vol.1.

Through his playing, the trumpet emerged as a solo instrument in jazz and is used widely today. Additionally, jazz itself was transformed from a collectively improvised folk music to a soloist's serious art form largely through his influence. He was a masterful accompanist and ensemble player in addition to his extraordinary skills as a soloist. With his innovations, he raised the bar musically for all who came after him.\n

Its title track became secondnameplaceholder's second No. 1 single on the Hot 100. The album subsequently stayed on the charts for two years and sold over four million copies. The album was later hailed as "a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy".[76] Other singles from the album included "Come Get to This", which recalled secondnameplaceholder's early Motown soul sound of the previous decade, while the suggestive "You Sure Love to Ball" reached modest success on the R&B charts, while also managing to make the pop top 50, its success halted by radio refusing to play the sexually explicit song.[77]\n

Six months later, he joined the quartet of John Coltrane that included Elvin Jones and Steve Davis (later replaced by Art Davis, Reggie Workman, and, finally, Jimmy Garrison).[11][13] He worked with the band during its extended run at the Jazz Gallery, replacing Steve Kuhn. Coltrane had known secondnameplaceholder for a while growing up in Philadelphia.[14] He recorded the pianist's composition "The Believer" on January 10, 1958; it became the title track of Prestige's 1964 album The Believer issued as a John Coltrane record.[15][16] He played on Coltrane's My Favorite Things (1961) for Atlantic.[17] The band toured almost non-stop between 1961 and 1965, recording the albums Coltrane "Live" at the Village Vanguard (1962), Ballads (1963), John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963), Live at Birdland (1964), Crescent (1964), A Love Supreme (1964), and The John Coltrane Quartet Plays (1965), all for Impulse!

 While in Coltrane's group, he recorded albums in a piano trio.

Reviewing the album in 2017, Marc Myers of JazzWax said,  "...the finest of these straightforward piano recordings was Nights of Ballads & Blues. secondnameplaceholder's playing is exciting and exceptional on all of the tracks...  On the album, he exhibits a reserved elegance and tenderness that reveals the other side of his personality—a lover of melody and standards. In this regard, there are traces of Oscar Peterson in his playing. Perhaps Thiele was using secondnameplaceholder to take a bite out of Peterson's vast and successful early-'60s share of the jazz market."[19] secondnameplaceholder also appeared as a sideman on many Blue Note albums of the 1960s, although he was often credited as "etc." on the cover of these albums to respect his contract with Impulse!.[11]\n

Linna suggests: "secondnameplaceholder would eventually find a way of dealing with the two directions simultaneously, in a manner that was supportive and complementary yet original and slightly different from Coltrane's approach." After 1960 Coltrane did not hire anyone at the piano if secondnameplaceholder was not available; between secondnameplaceholder joining the group (around the end of May 1960) and leaving (in December 1965), there was nobody else at the piano accompanying Coltrane.[20]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Michael Lee Aday (born Marvin Lee Aday, September 27, 1947), better known as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, is an American singer and actor.

In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court, and secondnameplaceholder was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, secondnameplaceholder died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was subsequently convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n

In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes.\n
 In Bad, secondnameplaceholder's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song "Dirty Diana".[429] The lead single "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" is a traditional love ballad, and "Man in the Mirror" is a ballad of confession and resolution. "Smooth Criminal" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder.[132] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents secondnameplaceholder as a paradoxical person.[430] The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like "Jam" and "Remember the Time". It was the first secondnameplaceholder album in which social ills became a primary theme; "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as "In the Closet". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as "Will You Be There", "Heal the World" and "Keep the Faith".[409] In the ballad "Gone Too Soon", secondnameplaceholder gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.[431]\n

Sneddon Jr., who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases. He describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive". Sneddon said he had not listened to the song.[434] Invincible was produced by Rodney Jerkins.[8] It includes urban soul tracks such as "Cry" and "The Lost Children", ballads such as "Speechless", "Break of Dawn", and "Butterflies" and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker" and "Invincible".[435][436]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  He has also composed the music for the children's television series Titch[8] which is based on the books written and illustrated by Pat Hutchins.\n

Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the saxophone to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, it later switched to a fully amplified line-up of string quartet, three saxophones, trumpet, horn, bass trombone, bass guitar and piano. This line up has been variously altered and augmented for some works.\n

Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album 'Round About Midnight.[2] It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish music-influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as firstnameplaceholdertones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959).[3] The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,[4] having sold over five million copies in the U.S.\n

After the frontman quit, Murcia and Sylvain started a clothing business called Truth and Soul and Sylvain took a job at A Different Drummer,[11] a men's boutique that was across the street from the firstnameplaceholder York Doll Hospital, a doll repair shop. Sylvain said that the shop inspired the name for their future band. In 1970 they formed a band again and recruited Johnny Thunders to join on bass, though Sylvain ended up teaching him to play guitar. They called themselves the Dolls. When Sylvain left the band to spend a few months in London, Thunders and Murcia went their separate ways.\n

At Thunders' suggestion, Murcia replaced the original drummer. Thunders played lead guitar and sang for the band Actress. An October 1971 rehearsal tape recorded by Rivets was released as Dawn of the Dolls. When Thunders decided that he no longer wanted to be the front man, David Johansen joined the band. Initially, the group was composed of singer David Johansen, guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets (who was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain after a few months), bass guitarist Arthur "Killer" Kane and drummer Billy Murcia.\n

Drug and alcohol abuse by Thunders, Nolan, and Kane, as well as artistic differences added to the tensions among members. In late February or early March, Malcolm McLaren became their informal manager. He got the band red leather outfits to wear on stage and a communist flag as backdrop. The Dolls did a five-concert tour of firstnameplaceholder York's five boroughs, supported by Television and Pure Hell.  The Little Hippodrome (Manhattan) show was recorded and released by Fan Club records in 1982 as Red Patent Leather. It was originally a bootleg album that was later remixed by Sylvain, with former manager Marty Thau credited as executive producer. Due to Kane being unable to play that night, roadie Peter Jordan played bass, though he was credited as having played "second bass". Jordan filled in for Kane when he was too inebriated to play.\n

Jordan replaced Kane for most of those shows. Thunders and Nolan left after an argument. Blackie Lawless, who later found W.A.S.P., replaced Thunders for the remainder of the tour after which the band broke up.[9][19][20]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The band reformed in July for an August tour in Japan with Jeff Beck and Felix Pappalardi. Johansen, Sylvain and Jordan were joined by former Elephant's Memory keyboardist Chris Robison and drummer Tony Machine. One of the shows was documented on the album Tokyo Dolls Live (Fan Club/firstnameplaceholder Rose). The material is similar to that on Red Patent Leather, but notable for a radically re-arranged "Frankenstein" and a cover of Big Joe Turner's "Flip Flop Fly." The album is undated and has no production credit, but was issued circa 1986.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       After their return to firstnameplaceholder York, the Dolls resumed playing shows in the US and Canada. Their show at the Beacon Theater, on firstnameplaceholder Year's Eve, 1975 met with great critical acclaim. After a drunken argument with Sylvain, Robison was fired and replaced by pianist/keyboardist Bobbie Blaine.[21][9] The group toured throughout 1976, performing a set including some songs with lyrics by David Johansen that would later appear on David Johansen's solo albums including "Funky But Chic", "Frenchette" and "Wreckless Crazy.” The group played its last show December 30, 1976 at Max's Kansas City; on the same bill as Blondie.[9]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Shortly after returning from Florida, Thunders and Nolan formed The Heartbreakers with bassist Richard Hell, who had left Television the same week that they quit the Dolls. Thunders later pursued a solo career. He died in firstnameplaceholder Orleans in 1991, allegedly of an overdose of both heroin and methadone.[22] It also came to light that he suffered from t-cell leukemia. Nolan died in 1992 following a stroke, brought about by bacterial meningitis.  In 1976, Kane and Blackie Lawless formed the Killer Kane Band in Los Angeles. Immediately after the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' second breakup, Johansen began a solo career.  By the late 1980s, he achieved moderate success under the pseudonym, Buster Poindexter.  Sylvain formed The Criminals, a popular band at CBGB.\n
                              A posthumous firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder album, Lipstick Killers, made up of early demo tapes of the original Dolls (with Billy Murcia on drums), was released in a cassette-only edition on ROIR Records in 1981, and subsequently re-released on CD, and then on vinyl in early 2006. All the tracks from this title – sometimes referred to as The Mercer Street Sessions (though actually recorded at Blue Rock Studio, firstnameplaceholder York) – are included on the CD Private World, along with other tracks recorded elsewhere, including a previously unreleased Dolls original, "Endless Party." Three more unreleased studio tracks, including another previously unreleased Dolls original, "Lone Star Queen," are included on the Rock 'n' Roll album. The other two are covers: the "Courageous Cat" theme, from the original Courageous Cat cartoon series; and a second attempt at "Don't Mess With Cupid," a song written by Steve Cropper and Eddie Floyd for Otis Redding, and first recorded independently for what was later to become the Mercer Street/Blue Rock Sessions.\n

He later became a taxicab driver in firstnameplaceholder York. \n

His band, for that record, consisted of Brian Keats on drums, Dave Vanian's Phantom Chords, Speediejohn Carlucci (who had played with the Fuzztones), and Olivier Le Baron on lead guitar. Guest appearances by Frank Infante of Blondie and Derwood Andrews of Generation X were also included on the record. It has been re-released as firstnameplaceholder York A Go Go,.\n

Thunders later pursued a solo career. He died in firstnameplaceholder Orleans in 1991, allegedly of an overdose of both heroin and methadone.[22] It also came to light that he suffered from t-cell leukemia. Nolan died in 1992 following a stroke, brought about by bacterial meningitis.  In 1976, Kane and Blackie Lawless formed the Killer Kane Band in Los Angeles. Immediately after the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' second breakup, Johansen began a solo career.  By the late 1980s, he achieved moderate success under the pseudonym, Buster Poindexter.  Sylvain formed The Criminals, a popular band at CBGB.\n
                              A posthumous firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder album, Lipstick Killers, made up of early demo tapes of the original Dolls (with Billy Murcia on drums), was released in a cassette-only edition on ROIR Records in 1981, and subsequently re-released on CD, and then on vinyl in early 2006. All the tracks from this title – sometimes referred to as The Mercer Street Sessions (though actually recorded at Blue Rock Studio, firstnameplaceholder York) – are included on the CD Private World, along with other tracks recorded elsewhere, including a previously unreleased Dolls original, "Endless Party." Three more unreleased studio tracks, including another previously unreleased Dolls original, "Lone Star Queen," are included on the Rock 'n' Roll album. The other two are covers: the "Courageous Cat" theme, from the original Courageous Cat cartoon series; and a second attempt at "Don't Mess With Cupid," a song written by Steve Cropper and Eddie Floyd for Otis Redding, and first recorded independently for what was later to become the Mercer Street/Blue Rock Sessions.\n

Though he never found a wide audience during his lifetime, his work has gradually achieved wider notice and recognition.[2][3][4] secondnameplaceholder signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and a student at the University of Cambridge. He released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums—Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release.[5] His reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. There is no known video footage of the adult secondnameplaceholder; he was only ever captured in still photographs and in home footage from his childhood.[6]\n

On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, secondnameplaceholder died from an overdose of amitriptyline, a prescribed antidepressant; he was 26 years old. Whether his death was an accident or suicide has never been resolved.\n

By the mid-1980s, secondnameplaceholder was being credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith of The Cure and Peter Buck of R.E.M. In 1985, The Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with "Life in a Northern Town", a song written for and dedicated to secondnameplaceholder.[7] By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a certain type of "doomed romantic" musician in the UK music press and was frequently cited as an influence by artists including Kate Bush, Paul Weller, Aimee Mann, Beck, and The Black Crowes.[8] His first biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us.\n

I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into my room and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!"[31]\n

His father remembered "writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge ... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least you have something to fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net was the one thing he did not want."[13] secondnameplaceholder spent his first few months in London drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat but usually sleeping on friends' sofas and floors.[43] Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into secondnameplaceholder's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.[44]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nOn 5 August 1969, secondnameplaceholder recorded five songs for the BBC's John Peel show ("Cello Song", "Three Hours", "River Man", "Time of No Reply" and an early version of "Bryter Layter"), three of which were broadcast the following night. A month later, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Folk singer Michael Chapman said of the performances:
 The experience reinforced secondnameplaceholder's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. secondnameplaceholder seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.[45] Although Five Leaves Left attracted little publicity, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. secondnameplaceholder's second album, Bryter Layter (1971),[46] again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.[47][48] Disappointed by his debut's poor sales, secondnameplaceholder sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. "It was more of a pop sound, I suppose," Boyd later said. "I imagined it as more commercial."[49] Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: "Northern Sky" and "Fly". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of "Northern Sky" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest secondnameplaceholder came to a release with chart potential.[50] Cale used heroin during this period,[51] and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that secondnameplaceholder was also using.[52]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bryter Layter was a commercial failure, and reviews were again mixed; Record Mirror praised secondnameplaceholder as a "beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements", but Melody Maker described the album as "an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz".[45] Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led secondnameplaceholder into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, secondnameplaceholder gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: "firstnameplaceholder was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it."[53]\n
                                                                                                          In 1971, secondnameplaceholder's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends.[54] He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.[55] Island Records urged secondnameplaceholder to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. secondnameplaceholder, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as "unbelievable amounts" of cannabis[56] and exhibiting "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs.[57] According to photographer Keith Morris by 1971 secondnameplaceholder was a "hunched, dishevelled figure, staring vacantly...ignoring the overtures of a friendly labrador or gazing blankly over Hampstead Heath."[58] His sister recalled: "This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong."[57]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAlthough Island neither expected nor wanted a third album,[59] secondnameplaceholder approached Wood in October 1971 to begin work on what would be his final release. Sessions took place over two nights, with only secondnameplaceholder and Wood present in the studio.[4] The bleak songs of Pink Moon are short, and the eleven-track album lasts only 28 minutes, a length described by Wood as "just about right. You really wouldn't want it to be any longer."[17] secondnameplaceholder had expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of Bryter Layter, and believed that the string, brass and saxophone arrangements resulted in a sound that was "too full, too elaborate".[60] secondnameplaceholder appears on Pink Moon accompanied only by his own carefully recorded guitar save for a piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He definitely wanted it to be him more than anything. And I think, in some ways, Pink Moon is probably more like firstnameplaceholder is than the other two records."[61]
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  secondnameplaceholder delivered the tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island Records, contrary to a popular legend which claims he dropped them off at the receptionist's desk without saying a word.[63] An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with "Pink Moon—firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished."[64] Pink Moon sold fewer copies than its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In Zigzag, Connor McKnight wrote: "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that."[65]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Blackwell felt Pink Moon had the potential to bring secondnameplaceholder to a mainstream audience; however, his staff were disappointed by secondnameplaceholder's unwillingness to promote it. A&R manager Muff Winwood recalled "tearing his hair out" in frustration and said that without Blackwell's enthusiastic support "the rest of us would have given him the boot".[66] At Boyd's insistence, secondnameplaceholder agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of Sounds Magazine.[67] The "shy and introverted" secondnameplaceholder spoke of his dislike of live appearances and little else.[68] "There wasn't any connection whatsoever," Gilbert said. "I don't think he made eye contact with me once."[68] Disheartened and convinced he would be unable to write again, secondnameplaceholder retired from music. He toyed with the idea of a different career, and considered the army.[69] His three albums had together sold fewer than 4,000 copies.[45]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nIn the months following Pink Moon's release, secondnameplaceholder became increasingly asocial and distant.[70] He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. "I don't like it at home," he told his mother, "but I can't bear it anywhere else."[13] His return was often difficult for his family, as Gabrielle said: "Good days in my parents' home were good days for firstnameplaceholder, and bad days were bad days for firstnameplaceholder. And that was what their life revolved around, really."[17]
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               secondnameplaceholder lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £244 in 2019[20]). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes.[72] He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back."[73] firstnameplaceholder's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around."[74]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           John Martyn (who in 1973 wrote the title song of his album Solid Air about secondnameplaceholder) described secondnameplaceholder in this period as the most withdrawn person he had ever met.[75] He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose, until he ran out of petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed.[76] During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.[69] Early in 1972, secondnameplaceholder had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.[52] He was initially believed to suffer from major depression, although his former therapist suggested he was suffering from schizophrenia.[77]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In February 1973, secondnameplaceholder contacted John Wood, stating he was ready to begin work on a fourth album.[46] Boyd was in England at the time, and agreed to attend the recordings. The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974. In his 2006 autobiography, Boyd recalled being taken aback at secondnameplaceholder's anger and bitterness: "[He said that] I had told him he was a genius, and others had concurred. Why wasn't he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years."[78] Boyd and Wood noticed a deterioration in secondnameplaceholder's performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to Sound Techniques' studio raised secondnameplaceholder's spirits; his mother recalled, "We were so absolutely thrilled to think that firstnameplaceholder was happy because there hadn't been any happiness in firstnameplaceholder's life for years."[52]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        By late 1974, secondnameplaceholder's weekly retainer from Island had ceased, and his severe depression meant he remained in contact with only a few close friends. He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde, whom he had met in London in 1968.[79] Ryde has been described by secondnameplaceholder's biographers as "the nearest thing" to a girlfriend in his life, but she used the description "best (girl) friend".[80] In a 2005 interview, Ryde said that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And I never saw him again."[81] As with the relationship he had shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, secondnameplaceholder's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.[81]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    During the early hours of 25 November 1974, secondnameplaceholder died at his home from an overdose of amitriptyline, an antidepressant. He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family had heard him do this many times before, and presumed he was eating cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills "to help him sleep".[82][clarification needed]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        secondnameplaceholder had been accustomed to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. His mother later said: "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs."[83] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.[84]\n
 The experience reinforced secondnameplaceholder's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. secondnameplaceholder seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.[45] Although Five Leaves Left attracted little publicity, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. secondnameplaceholder's second album, Bryter Layter (1971),[46] again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.[47][48] Disappointed by his debut's poor sales, secondnameplaceholder sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. "It was more of a pop sound, I suppose," Boyd later said. "I imagined it as more commercial."[49] Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: "Northern Sky" and "Fly". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of "Northern Sky" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest secondnameplaceholder came to a release with chart potential.[50] Cale used heroin during this period,[51] and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that secondnameplaceholder was also using.[52]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bryter Layter was a commercial failure, and reviews were again mixed; Record Mirror praised secondnameplaceholder as a "beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements", but Melody Maker described the album as "an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz".[45] Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led secondnameplaceholder into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, secondnameplaceholder gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: "firstnameplaceholder was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it."[53]\n
                                                                                                          In 1971, secondnameplaceholder's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends.[54] He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.[55] Island Records urged secondnameplaceholder to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. secondnameplaceholder, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as "unbelievable amounts" of cannabis[56] and exhibiting "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs.[57] According to photographer Keith Morris by 1971 secondnameplaceholder was a "hunched, dishevelled figure, staring vacantly...ignoring the overtures of a friendly labrador or gazing blankly over Hampstead Heath."[58] His sister recalled: "This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong."[57]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAlthough Island neither expected nor wanted a third album,[59] secondnameplaceholder approached Wood in October 1971 to begin work on what would be his final release. Sessions took place over two nights, with only secondnameplaceholder and Wood present in the studio.[4] The bleak songs of Pink Moon are short, and the eleven-track album lasts only 28 minutes, a length described by Wood as "just about right. You really wouldn't want it to be any longer."[17] secondnameplaceholder had expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of Bryter Layter, and believed that the string, brass and saxophone arrangements resulted in a sound that was "too full, too elaborate".[60] secondnameplaceholder appears on Pink Moon accompanied only by his own carefully recorded guitar save for a piano overdub on the title track. Wood later said: "He was very determined to make this very stark, bare record. He definitely wanted it to be him more than anything. And I think, in some ways, Pink Moon is probably more like firstnameplaceholder is than the other two records."[61]
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  secondnameplaceholder delivered the tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island Records, contrary to a popular legend which claims he dropped them off at the receptionist's desk without saying a word.[63] An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with "Pink Moon—firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished."[64] Pink Moon sold fewer copies than its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In Zigzag, Connor McKnight wrote: "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that."[65]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Blackwell felt Pink Moon had the potential to bring secondnameplaceholder to a mainstream audience; however, his staff were disappointed by secondnameplaceholder's unwillingness to promote it. A&R manager Muff Winwood recalled "tearing his hair out" in frustration and said that without Blackwell's enthusiastic support "the rest of us would have given him the boot".[66] At Boyd's insistence, secondnameplaceholder agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of Sounds Magazine.[67] The "shy and introverted" secondnameplaceholder spoke of his dislike of live appearances and little else.[68] "There wasn't any connection whatsoever," Gilbert said. "I don't think he made eye contact with me once."[68] Disheartened and convinced he would be unable to write again, secondnameplaceholder retired from music. He toyed with the idea of a different career, and considered the army.[69] His three albums had together sold fewer than 4,000 copies.[45]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nIn the months following Pink Moon's release, secondnameplaceholder became increasingly asocial and distant.[70] He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. "I don't like it at home," he told his mother, "but I can't bear it anywhere else."[13] His return was often difficult for his family, as Gabrielle said: "Good days in my parents' home were good days for firstnameplaceholder, and bad days were bad days for firstnameplaceholder. And that was what their life revolved around, really."[17]
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               secondnameplaceholder lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £244 in 2019[20]). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes.[72] He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back."[73] firstnameplaceholder's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around."[74]\n

Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed.[76] During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.[69] Early in 1972, secondnameplaceholder had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.[52] He was initially believed to suffer from major depression, although his former therapist suggested he was suffering from schizophrenia.[77]\n

The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974. In his 2006 autobiography, Boyd recalled being taken aback at secondnameplaceholder's anger and bitterness: "[He said that] I had told him he was a genius, and others had concurred. Why wasn't he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years."[78] Boyd and Wood noticed a deterioration in secondnameplaceholder's performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to Sound Techniques' studio raised secondnameplaceholder's spirits; his mother recalled, "We were so absolutely thrilled to think that firstnameplaceholder was happy because there hadn't been any happiness in firstnameplaceholder's life for years."[52]\n

He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde, whom he had met in London in 1968.[79] Ryde has been described by secondnameplaceholder's biographers as "the nearest thing" to a girlfriend in his life, but she used the description "best (girl) friend".[80] In a 2005 interview, Ryde said that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And I never saw him again."[81] As with the relationship he had shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, secondnameplaceholder's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.[81]\n

He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family had heard him do this many times before, and presumed he was eating cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills "to help him sleep".[82][clarification needed]\n

His mother later said: "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs."[83] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.[84]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  secondnameplaceholder delivered the tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island Records, contrary to a popular legend which claims he dropped them off at the receptionist's desk without saying a word.[63] An advertisement for the album in Melody Maker in February opened with "Pink Moon—firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's latest album: the first we heard of it was when it was finished."[64] Pink Moon sold fewer copies than its predecessors, although it received some favourable reviews. In Zigzag, Connor McKnight wrote: "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is an artist who never fakes. The album makes no concession to the theory that music should be escapist. It's simply one musician's view of life at the time, and you can't ask for more than that."[65]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Blackwell felt Pink Moon had the potential to bring secondnameplaceholder to a mainstream audience; however, his staff were disappointed by secondnameplaceholder's unwillingness to promote it. A&R manager Muff Winwood recalled "tearing his hair out" in frustration and said that without Blackwell's enthusiastic support "the rest of us would have given him the boot".[66] At Boyd's insistence, secondnameplaceholder agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of Sounds Magazine.[67] The "shy and introverted" secondnameplaceholder spoke of his dislike of live appearances and little else.[68] "There wasn't any connection whatsoever," Gilbert said. "I don't think he made eye contact with me once."[68] Disheartened and convinced he would be unable to write again, secondnameplaceholder retired from music. He toyed with the idea of a different career, and considered the army.[69] His three albums had together sold fewer than 4,000 copies.[45]\n

"I don't like it at home," he told his mother, "but I can't bear it anywhere else."[13] His return was often difficult for his family, as Gabrielle said: "Good days in my parents' home were good days for firstnameplaceholder, and bad days were bad days for firstnameplaceholder. And that was what their life revolved around, really."[17]
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               secondnameplaceholder lived a frugal existence; his only income was a £20-a-week retainer he received from Island Records (equivalent to £244 in 2019[20]). At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes.[72] He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back."[73] firstnameplaceholder's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around."[74]\n

Friends recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed.[76] During particularly bleak periods, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails.[69] Early in 1972, secondnameplaceholder had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.[52] He was initially believed to suffer from major depression, although his former therapist suggested he was suffering from schizophrenia.[77]\n

The initial session was followed by recordings in July 1974. In his 2006 autobiography, Boyd recalled being taken aback at secondnameplaceholder's anger and bitterness: "[He said that] I had told him he was a genius, and others had concurred. Why wasn't he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years."[78] Boyd and Wood noticed a deterioration in secondnameplaceholder's performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to Sound Techniques' studio raised secondnameplaceholder's spirits; his mother recalled, "We were so absolutely thrilled to think that firstnameplaceholder was happy because there hadn't been any happiness in firstnameplaceholder's life for years."[52]\n

He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde, whom he had met in London in 1968.[79] Ryde has been described by secondnameplaceholder's biographers as "the nearest thing" to a girlfriend in his life, but she used the description "best (girl) friend".[80] In a 2005 interview, Ryde said that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And I never saw him again."[81] As with the relationship he had shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, secondnameplaceholder's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.[81]\n

He had gone to bed early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family had heard him do this many times before, and presumed he was eating cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills "to help him sleep".[82][clarification needed]\n

His mother later said: "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long, long legs."[83] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.[84]\n

At one point he could not afford a new pair of shoes.[72] He would disappear for days, sometimes arriving unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back."[73] firstnameplaceholder's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously depressed: "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around."[74]\n

His family had heard him do this many times before, and presumed he was eating cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills "to help him sleep".[82][clarification needed]\n

 To make a living, secondnameplaceholder started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to "firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play "the devil's music"[3] or so-called "cocktail piano". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.[5] She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with "I Loves You, Porgy".[1] Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach,[6] and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.[7][8]\n firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, commonly abbreviated as NIN and stylized as NIИ, is an American industrial rock band formed in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician Atticus Ross in 2016.

After feuding with TVT about how to promote the album, Reznor signed with Interscope Records and released the EP Broken (1992). The following firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder albums, The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n
                       Following a hiatus, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, With Teeth (2005). Following the release of Year Zero (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder continued touring and independently released Ghosts I–IV (2008) and The Slip (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, Hesitation Marks (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs Not the Actual Events (2016) and Add Violence (2017) and their ninth album Bad Witch (2018). In 2020, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder released two further installments in the Ghosts series, Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts.\n
  When touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder name. Not including sporadic band hiatuses, this live band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005), and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2009) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting; songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.\n

The band's diamond-certified album Tragic Kingdom (1995) benefited from the resurgence of third-wave ska in the 1990s, and "Don't Speak", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. "Just a Girl", co-written by Stefani, was described as "the most popular cut on the CD".[2]\n

Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with the album Rock Steady (2001), which incorporated reggae and dancehall music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in Jamaica and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists Bounty Killer, Sly and Robbie, and Lady Saw. The album produced two Grammy-winning singles, "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All". "Hella Good" was also nominated for a Grammy award. On firstnameplaceholdervember 22, 2002, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in Disneyland during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' (KROQ-FM) where they performed five songs.[3] After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (2004) and The Sweet Escape (2006), while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, Invincible Overlord. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth and latest effort, titled Push and Shove (2012), and released their single "Settle Down". They have sold over 33 million records worldwide.\n

Trauma sued for US$100 million for breach of contract, fraud, and extortion and sought to have its joint venture agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected.[12] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was "really great...because now we have the attention and the focus of a small indie label."[19] The case was settled out of court with a $3 million payment.[20]\n
 The band finished its tour in December 1997 and had several releases during the two-year writing process to make its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom.[4] Live in the Tragic Kingdom, a live long-form video of the band's performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, was released and The Beacon Street Collection was re-released while the band was on tour that year. The band recorded "I Throw My Toys Around" with Elvis Costello for The Rugrats Movie, and it contributed to The Clash's tribute album Burning London: The Clash Tribute. Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Prince, Fishbone & Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale's band Bush. After some time in-between albums, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder included its song "New" on the soundtrack to the movie Go in 1999. "New", inspired by Gwen's budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of Tragic Kingdom.\nIn 2000, the band released Return of Saturn, its follow-up to Tragic Kingdom. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's previous work.[21] The main lyrical focus of the new record had shifted from Gwen Stefani's relationship with bassist Tony Kanal to her new relationship with Gavin Rossdale.[15] Return of Saturn was critically acclaimed, but was not as commercially successful as their previous album, and the lead single, "Ex-Girlfriend", failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States.

During this time, it contributed a cover version of Donna Summer's "Love to Love You Baby" for the Zoolander soundtrack and recorded a song with Kelis for her album Wanderland. Stefani made high-profile appearances on Moby's "South Side" and Eve's "Let Me Blow Ya Mind". These appearances lent firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder credibility and an opportunity to explore new genres.[22] Highly influenced by Jamaican dancehall music and recorded primarily in Jamaica, the band's 2001 studio album, Rock Steady, produced two hit Grammy-winning singles, "Hey Baby", which featured Bounty Killer, and "Underneath It All", which featured the first lady of dancehall, Lady Saw. Both singles managed to reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also released "Hella Good" and "Running" as singles. In addition, pop-star Prince co-wrote, produced, and performed on "Waiting Room" from Rock Steady. Stefani had previously provided vocals for a song on Prince's Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic album, "So Far, So Pleased".

The lawsuit alleged that the game had "transformed firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder band members into a virtual karaoke circus act", singing dozens of songs the group neither wrote, popularized, nor approved for use in the game. The case was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and cited Activision, the game's distributor, as having exceeded contractual likenesses of the members of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[70]\n

The court then explained: "The band also learned that female lead singer Gwen Stefani's avatar could be made to sing in a male voice, and the male band members' avatars could be manipulated to sing songs in female voices. The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups."

 He considered the trio with Brown and Ellis "the most stimulating" and productive setting for public performances and studio recordings. In the early 1950s, he began performing with Brown and drummer Charlie Smith as the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Trio.

"That's What My Heart Needs" and "Mary's Little Lamb" were recorded in June 1963. The latter is the only secondnameplaceholder track with both background singing and brass. It became his worst-selling single.[25][27] The title track, recorded in September 1963, sparked copyright issues, as it sounded like Irma Thomas's "Ruler of My Heart".[25] Despite this, Pain in My Heart was released on March  1964,[28][29] with the single peaking at number 11 on the R&B chart, number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the album at number 103 on the Billboard 200.[30]\n

The trio asked Walden for money. Huckaby's description of their circumstances living in the "big old raggedy" Hotel Theresa is quoted by Peter Guralnick in his book Sweet Soul Music. He noted meeting Muhammad Ali and other celebrities. Ben E. King, who was the headliner at the Apollo when secondnameplaceholder performed there, gave him $100 (US$845 in 2020 dollars[13]) when he learned about secondnameplaceholder's financial situation. The resulting album featured King, the Coasters, Doris Troy, Rufus Thomas, the Falcons and secondnameplaceholder.[31] Around this time Walden and Rodgers were drafted by the army; Walden's younger brother Alan joined secondnameplaceholder on tour, while Earl "Speedo" Simms replaced Rodgers as secondnameplaceholder's road manager.[32]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Most of secondnameplaceholder's songs after "Security", from his first album, had a slow tempo. Disc jockey A. C. Moohah Williams accordingly labeled him "Mr. Pitiful",[33] and subsequently, Cropper and secondnameplaceholder wrote the eponymous song.[23] That and top 100 singles " Chained and Bound", "Come to Me" and "That's How Strong My Love Is"[34] were included on secondnameplaceholder's second studio album, The Great firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Sings Soul Ballads, released in March 1965.[35] Jenkins began working independently from the group out of fear Galkin, Walden and Cropper would plagiarize his playing style, and so Cropper became secondnameplaceholder's leading guitarist.[36] Around 1965, secondnameplaceholder co-wrote "I've Been Loving You Too Long" with Jerry Butler, the former lead singer of the Impressions. That summer, secondnameplaceholder and the studio crew arranged new songs for his next album. Ten of the eleven songs were recorded in a 24-hour period on July 9 and 10 in Memphis. Two songs, "Ole Man Trouble" and "Respect", had been finished earlier, during the firstnameplaceholder Blue session. "Respect" and "I've Been Loving You" were later recut in stereo. The album, entitled firstnameplaceholder Blue: firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Sings Soul, was released in September 1965.[37] firstnameplaceholder Blue also includes secondnameplaceholder's much-loved cover of "A Change Is Gonna Come" in 1965.[38]\n

Walden signed more musicians, including Percy Sledge, Johnnie Taylor, Clarence Carter and Eddie Floyd, and together with secondnameplaceholder, they founded two production companies. "Jotis Records" (derived from Joe Galkin and firstnameplaceholder) released four recordings, two by Arthur Conley and one by Billy Young and Loretta Williams. The other was named Redwal Music (derived from Redding and Walden), which was shut down shortly after its creation.[42] Since Afro-Americans still formed the majority of fans, secondnameplaceholder chose to perform at Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. secondnameplaceholder was one of the first soul artists to perform for rock audiences in the western United States. His performance received critical acclaim, including positive press in the Los Angeles Times, and he penetrated mainstream popular culture. Bob Dylan attended the performance and offered secondnameplaceholder an altered version of one of his songs, "Just Like a Woman".[23]\n

Woods in 1932.[39]  This song had previously been covered by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and the publishers unsuccessfully tried to stop secondnameplaceholder from recording the song from a "negro perspective".  Today often considered his signature song,[43]  Jim Stewart reckoned, "If there's one song, one performance that really sort of sums up firstnameplaceholder and what he's about, it's 'Try a Little Tenderness'.  That one performance is so special and so unique that it expresses who he is."  On this version secondnameplaceholder was backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, while staff producer Isaac Hayes worked on the arrangement.[44][45]  "Try a Little Tenderness" was included on his next album, Complete & Unbelievable: The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Dictionary of Soul.  The song and the album were critically and commercially successful—the former peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number 4 on the R&B chart.[46]\n

When the crew arrived in London, the Beatles sent a limousine to pick them up.[47]  Booking agent Bill Graham proposed that secondnameplaceholder play at the Fillmore Auditorium in late 1966.  The gig was commercially and critically successful, paying secondnameplaceholder around $800 to $1000 (US$7,976 in 2020 dollars[13]) a night.[49][45] It prompted Graham to remark afterward, "That was the best gig I ever put on in my entire life."[50] secondnameplaceholder began touring Europe six months later.[51]\n

It was Jim Stewart's idea to produce a duet album, as he expected that "[secondnameplaceholder's] rawness and [Thomas's] sophistication would work".[52] The album was recorded in January 1967, while Thomas was earning her M.A. in English at Howard University. Six out of ten songs were cut during their joint session; the rest were overdubbed by secondnameplaceholder in the days following, because of his concert obligations. Three singles were lifted from the album: "Tramp" was released in April, followed by "Knock on Wood" and "Lovey Dovey". All three reached at least the top 60 on both the R&B and Pop charts.[52] The album charted at number 5 and 36 on the Billboard Pop and R&B charts, respectively.[34]\n

The live album firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: Live in Europe was released three months later, featuring this and other live performances in London and Stockholm, Sweden.[41]  His decision to take his protege Conley (whom secondnameplaceholder and Walden had contracted directly to Atco/Atlantic Records rather than to Stax/Volt) on the tour, instead of more established Stax/Volt artists such as Rufus Thomas and William Bell, produced negative reactions.[45][53]\n
 In 1967, secondnameplaceholder performed at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, the second day of the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler.[54] Until that point, secondnameplaceholder was still performing mainly for black audiences.[55]  At the time, he "had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market."[56] But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, "his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's career."[56] His act included his own song "Respect" and a version of the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction."[57] secondnameplaceholder and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's "Shake", after which he delivered an impromptu speech, asking the audience if they were the "love crowd"[58] and looking for a big response. The ballad "I've Been Loving You" followed. The last song was "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said secondnameplaceholder and left the stage of his last major concert.[43] According to Booker T. Jones, "I think we did one of our best shows, firstnameplaceholder and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved firstnameplaceholder. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey."[59] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens."[60]\n

The two moved from Memphis to Macon to continue writing. The result was "Sweet Soul Music" (based on Cooke's "Yeah Man"),[42] which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.[61][62] By that time, secondnameplaceholder had developed polyps on his larynx, which he tried to treat with tea and lemon or honey. He was hospitalized in September 1967 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to undergo surgery.[63]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In early December 1967, secondnameplaceholder again recorded at Stax. One new song was "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay", which was written with Cropper.[64] secondnameplaceholder was inspired by the Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and tried to create a similar sound, against the label's wishes. His wife Zelma disliked its atypical melody. The Stax crew were also dissatisfied with the new sound; Stewart thought that it was not R&B, while bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn feared it would damage Stax's reputation. However, secondnameplaceholder wanted to expand his musical style and thought it was his best song, correctly believing it would top the charts.[65] He whistled at the end, either forgetting Cropper's "fadeout rap" or paraphrasing it intentionally.[66]\n

Shortly thereafter, the plane crashed into Lake Monona. Bar-Kays member Ben Cauley, the accident's only survivor,[61] was sleeping shortly before the accident. He woke just before impact to see bandmate Phalon Jones look out a window and exclaim, "Oh, no!" Cauley said the last thing he remembered before the crash was unbuckling his seat belt. He then found himself in frigid water, grasping a seat cushion to keep afloat.[82][63] As a non-swimmer, he was unable to rescue the others.[84] The cause of the crash was never determined.[85] James Brown claimed in his autobiography The Godfather of Soul that he had warned secondnameplaceholder not to fly in the plane.[86] The other victims of the crash were four members of the Bar-Kays—guitarist Jimmy King, tenor saxophonist Phalon Jones, organist Ronnie Caldwell, and drummer Carl Cunningham; their valet, Matthew Kelly; and the pilot Fraser.[82][87]\n

More than 4,500 people came to the funeral, overflowing the 3,000-seat hall. Johnny Jenkins and Isaac Hayes did not attend, fearing their reaction would be worse than Zelma secondnameplaceholder's[further explanation needed].[89] secondnameplaceholder was entombed at his ranch in Round Oak, about twenty miles (30 km) north of Macon.[90] Jerry Wexler delivered the eulogy.[91] secondnameplaceholder died just three days after re-recording "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,"[92][61] and was survived by Zelma and four children, firstnameplaceholder III, Dexter, Demetria, and Karla.[72] On November 8, 1997, a memorial plaque was placed on the lakeside deck of the Madison convention center, Monona Terrace.[93]\n

Walden signed more musicians, including Percy Sledge, Johnnie Taylor, Clarence Carter and Eddie Floyd, and together with secondnameplaceholder, they founded two production companies. "Jotis Records" (derived from Joe Galkin and firstnameplaceholder) released four recordings, two by Arthur Conley and one by Billy Young and Loretta Williams. The other was named Redwal Music (derived from Redding and Walden), which was shut down shortly after its creation.[42] Since Afro-Americans still formed the majority of fans, secondnameplaceholder chose to perform at Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. secondnameplaceholder was one of the first soul artists to perform for rock audiences in the western United States. His performance received critical acclaim, including positive press in the Los Angeles Times, and he penetrated mainstream popular culture. Bob Dylan attended the performance and offered secondnameplaceholder an altered version of one of his songs, "Just Like a Woman".[23]\n

Woods in 1932.[39]  This song had previously been covered by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and the publishers unsuccessfully tried to stop secondnameplaceholder from recording the song from a "negro perspective".  Today often considered his signature song,[43]  Jim Stewart reckoned, "If there's one song, one performance that really sort of sums up firstnameplaceholder and what he's about, it's 'Try a Little Tenderness'.  That one performance is so special and so unique that it expresses who he is."  On this version secondnameplaceholder was backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, while staff producer Isaac Hayes worked on the arrangement.[44][45]  "Try a Little Tenderness" was included on his next album, Complete & Unbelievable: The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Dictionary of Soul.  The song and the album were critically and commercially successful—the former peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number 4 on the R&B chart.[46]\n

When the crew arrived in London, the Beatles sent a limousine to pick them up.[47]  Booking agent Bill Graham proposed that secondnameplaceholder play at the Fillmore Auditorium in late 1966.  The gig was commercially and critically successful, paying secondnameplaceholder around $800 to $1000 (US$7,976 in 2020 dollars[13]) a night.[49][45] It prompted Graham to remark afterward, "That was the best gig I ever put on in my entire life."[50] secondnameplaceholder began touring Europe six months later.[51]\n

It was Jim Stewart's idea to produce a duet album, as he expected that "[secondnameplaceholder's] rawness and [Thomas's] sophistication would work".[52] The album was recorded in January 1967, while Thomas was earning her M.A. in English at Howard University. Six out of ten songs were cut during their joint session; the rest were overdubbed by secondnameplaceholder in the days following, because of his concert obligations. Three singles were lifted from the album: "Tramp" was released in April, followed by "Knock on Wood" and "Lovey Dovey". All three reached at least the top 60 on both the R&B and Pop charts.[52] The album charted at number 5 and 36 on the Billboard Pop and R&B charts, respectively.[34]\n

The live album firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: Live in Europe was released three months later, featuring this and other live performances in London and Stockholm, Sweden.[41]  His decision to take his protege Conley (whom secondnameplaceholder and Walden had contracted directly to Atco/Atlantic Records rather than to Stax/Volt) on the tour, instead of more established Stax/Volt artists such as Rufus Thomas and William Bell, produced negative reactions.[45][53]\n
 In 1967, secondnameplaceholder performed at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, the second day of the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler.[54] Until that point, secondnameplaceholder was still performing mainly for black audiences.[55]  At the time, he "had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market."[56] But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, "his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's career."[56] His act included his own song "Respect" and a version of the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction."[57] secondnameplaceholder and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's "Shake", after which he delivered an impromptu speech, asking the audience if they were the "love crowd"[58] and looking for a big response. The ballad "I've Been Loving You" followed. The last song was "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said secondnameplaceholder and left the stage of his last major concert.[43] According to Booker T. Jones, "I think we did one of our best shows, firstnameplaceholder and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved firstnameplaceholder. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey."[59] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens."[60]\n

The two moved from Memphis to Macon to continue writing. The result was "Sweet Soul Music" (based on Cooke's "Yeah Man"),[42] which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.[61][62] By that time, secondnameplaceholder had developed polyps on his larynx, which he tried to treat with tea and lemon or honey. He was hospitalized in September 1967 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York to undergo surgery.[63]\n

One new song was "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay", which was written with Cropper.[64] secondnameplaceholder was inspired by the Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and tried to create a similar sound, against the label's wishes. His wife Zelma disliked its atypical melody. The Stax crew were also dissatisfied with the new sound; Stewart thought that it was not R&B, while bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn feared it would damage Stax's reputation. However, secondnameplaceholder wanted to expand his musical style and thought it was his best song, correctly believing it would top the charts.[65] He whistled at the end, either forgetting Cropper's "fadeout rap" or paraphrasing it intentionally.[66]\n

Shortly thereafter, the plane crashed into Lake Monona. Bar-Kays member Ben Cauley, the accident's only survivor,[61] was sleeping shortly before the accident. He woke just before impact to see bandmate Phalon Jones look out a window and exclaim, "Oh, no!" Cauley said the last thing he remembered before the crash was unbuckling his seat belt. He then found himself in frigid water, grasping a seat cushion to keep afloat.[82][63] As a non-swimmer, he was unable to rescue the others.[84] The cause of the crash was never determined.[85] James Brown claimed in his autobiography The Godfather of Soul that he had warned secondnameplaceholder not to fly in the plane.[86] The other victims of the crash were four members of the Bar-Kays—guitarist Jimmy King, tenor saxophonist Phalon Jones, organist Ronnie Caldwell, and drummer Carl Cunningham; their valet, Matthew Kelly; and the pilot Fraser.[82][87]\n

More than 4,500 people came to the funeral, overflowing the 3,000-seat hall. Johnny Jenkins and Isaac Hayes did not attend, fearing their reaction would be worse than Zelma secondnameplaceholder's[further explanation needed].[89] secondnameplaceholder was entombed at his ranch in Round Oak, about twenty miles (30 km) north of Macon.[90] Jerry Wexler delivered the eulogy.[91] secondnameplaceholder died just three days after re-recording "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,"[92][61] and was survived by Zelma and four children, firstnameplaceholder III, Dexter, Demetria, and Karla.[72] On November 8, 1997, a memorial plaque was placed on the lakeside deck of the Madison convention center, Monona Terrace.[93]\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Polly Jean secondnameplaceholder MBE (born 9 October 1969) is an English singer, songwriter, and musician.[1][2] Primarily known as a vocalist and guitarist, she is also proficient with a wide range of instruments.[3]\n

The band's frontman, John Parish, became her long-term collaborator.[4] In 1991, she formed an eponymous trio called firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and subsequently began her career as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. The trio released two studio albums called Dry (1992) and Rid of Me (1993) before disbanding, after which secondnameplaceholder continued as a solo artist. Since 1995, she has released a further nine studio albums with collaborations from various musicians including Parish, former bandmate Rob Ellis, Mick secondnameplaceholder, and Eric Drew Feldman, and has also worked extensively with record producer Flood.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Island (PolyGram) signed the trio amid a major label bidding war in mid-1992, and in December 1992 the trio travelled to Cannon Falls, Minnesota in the United States to record the follow-up to Dry with producer Steve Albini. Prior to recording with Albini, the band recorded a second session with John Peel on 22 September and recorded a version of Bob Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited," and two new songs "Me Jane" and "Ecstasy."[33] The recording sessions with Albini took place at Pachyderm Recording Studio and resulted in the band's major label debut Rid of Me in May 1993. Rolling Stone wrote that it "is charged with aggressive eroticism and rock fury. It careens from blues to goth to grunge, often in the space of a single song."[7] The album was promoted by two singles, "50ft Queenie" and "Man-Size", as well as tours of the United Kingdom in May and of the United States in June, continuing there during the summer.\n
 However, during the American leg of the tour, internal friction started to form between the members of the trio. Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed "an ever widening personal gulf" between the band members, and quoted secondnameplaceholder as saying "It makes me sad. I wouldn't have got here without them. I needed them back then – badly. But I don't need them anymore. We all changed as people."[34] Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (1993).[35] The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, secondnameplaceholder performed a solo version of "Rid of Me." As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.[36]\n
                                                                                                              As secondnameplaceholder embarked on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995 she released her third studio album, To Bring You My Love, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick secondnameplaceholder and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty, all of whom would continue to perform and record with secondnameplaceholder throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood.[37] Simultaneously a more blues-influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors, To Bring You My Love showcased secondnameplaceholder broadening her musical style to include strings, organs and synthesisers.[38] Rolling Stone said in its review that "secondnameplaceholder sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. To Bring You My Love was a towering goth version of grunge."[8] During the successive tours for the album, secondnameplaceholder also experimented with her image and stage persona.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In early 2000, secondnameplaceholder began work on her fifth studio album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea with Rob Ellis and Mick secondnameplaceholder. Written in her native Dorset, Paris and New York, the album showcased a more mainstream indie rock and pop rock sound to her previous albums and the lyrics followed themes of love that tied into secondnameplaceholder's affection for New York City.[49] The album also featured Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke on three tracks, including his lead vocals on "This Mess We're in." Upon its release in October 2000 the album was a critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and charting in both the United Kingdom[50] and the United States.[51] The album's three singles—"Good Fortune", "A Place Called Home" and "This Is Love"—were moderately successful.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is an American rock band from Vacaville, California, formed in 1993. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.\n
 After two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999. It released the triple-platinum Infest in 2000, the gold album Lovehatetragedy in 2002 and the platinum album Getting Away with Murder in 2004.

This included genres such as gospel, rockabilly, traditional country and pop.[37][25] Writers and music journalists have had mixed beliefs on secondnameplaceholder's Four Star material. Robert Oermann and Mary Bufwack of Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music called the label's choice of material "mediocre". They also commented that secondnameplaceholder seemed to have "groped for her own sound on the label".[25] Kurt Wolff of Country Music the Rough Guide commented that the music was "sturdy enough, but they only hinted at the potential that lurked inside her.[38] Richie Unterberger of Allmusic claimed it was secondnameplaceholder's voice that made the Four Star material less appealing: "Circumstances were not wholly to blame for secondnameplaceholder's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact, in comparison with her best work, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles."[39]\n
 "Crazy" was released as a single in October 1961, debuting on the Billboard country charts in November.[61] It would peak at number 2 there and number 9 on the same publication's pop charts.[51] "Crazy" would also become secondnameplaceholder's biggest pop hit.[64] "Crazy" has since been called a country music standard.[65] secondnameplaceholder's vocal performance and the song's production have received positive praise over time. Cub Koda of AllMusic noted the "ache" in her voice that makes the song stand out: "secondnameplaceholder's reading of the lyric is filled with an aching world weariness that transforms the tune into one of the first big crossover hits without even trying hard."[66] Country music historian Paul Kingsbury also highlighted her "ache", saying in 2007, "secondnameplaceholder's hit recording swings with such velvety finesse, and her voice throbs and aches so exquisitely, that the entire production sounds absolutely effortless."[65] Jhoni Jackon of Paste Magazine called the recording "iconic", highlighting the "pain" secondnameplaceholder had in her vocal technique.[67] Her second studio album firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Showcase was released in late 1961. The album featured both major hits from that year and re-recorded versions of "Walkin' After Midnight" and "A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)".[68]\n

Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann noted "Her thrilling voice invariably invested these with new depth. firstnameplaceholder's dramatic volume control, stretched-note effects, sobs, pauses and unique ways of holding back, then bursting into full-throated phrases also breathed new life into country chestnuts like "San Antonio Rose", "Blue Moon of Kentucky" and "Half as Much".[59] Richie Unterberger of AllMusic commented that her voice "sounded richer, more confident, and more mature, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations."[39] Kurt Wolff of Country Music the Rough Guide reported that Owen Bradley recognized potential in secondnameplaceholder's and once he gained studio control, he smoothed arrangements and "refine her voice into an instrument of torch-singing glory."[38]\n Patricia Jean secondnameplaceholder (born March 16, 1964) is an American singer-songwriter and musician.[1] She is a vocalist and plays guitar and piano.

Wings were noted for frequent personnel changes along with their commercial successes, going through three lead guitarists and four drummers. However, the core trio of the McCartneys and Laine remained intact throughout the group's existence.\n
 Created following the McCartneys' 1971 album Ram, the band's first two albums, Wild Life (1971) and Red Rose Speedway (1973) (the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough), were viewed as artistic disappointments beside firstnameplaceholder's work with the Beatles. After the release of the title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die, McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band. The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973's Band on the Run, a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in "Jet" and the title track. Following that album, the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English. With the new line-up, Wings released 1975's Venus and Mars, which included the US number one single "Listen to What the Man Said", and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975–76. Intended as more of a group effort, Wings at the Speed of Sound (1976) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles "Silly Love Songs" and "Let 'Em In".\n

Wings experienced another line-up shuffle, however, with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group's 1978 album London Town. The McCartneys and Laine again added new members, recruiting guitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley. The resulting album, Back to the Egg, was a relative flop, with its singles under-performing and the critical reception negative. During the supporting tour, firstnameplaceholder was arrested in Japan for cannabis possession, putting the band on hold. Despite a final US number one with a live-recorded version of "Coming Up" (1979), after Laine departed from the band, Wings discontinued in 1981.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            firstnameplaceholder Frederic secondnameplaceholder (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and actor. secondnameplaceholder's musical career has spanned over six decades.

The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame."[3]\n

As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."[3] By 1994's Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.[173] The band's 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism.[2] After Yield in 1998, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work,[66] they dabbled with experimental art rock on the Binaural album of 2000, and with folk rock elements on the 2002 Riot Act album. The band's 2006 album, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, was cited as a return to their early sound.[96][97] Their 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and new wave.[118]\n

His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals.[176] When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that."[177]\n

 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder were ranked at number 8 by Rolling Stone magazine in its Top Ten Live Acts of all Time issue.[6] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it "proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."[183] Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, "The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists."[19][55] In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.[184] In April 2006, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was awarded the prize for "Best Live Act" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder "the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last."[185] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder "toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon,  true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2."[3]\n

That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren't always easy, but I think we found a way."[186] Their 1992 MTV Unplugged performance was ranked second in Rolling Stone's list of its 15 Best Episodes.[187]\n

Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.[188][189] Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.[190] Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song "Army Reserve" (from firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder).[191]\n

In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.[192] In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote "PRO-CHOICE!" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song "Porch".[19][55] The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice.[189]\n

Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000,[193] and firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. president. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in."[194]\n

At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan,[196] and at the end of "Daughter", he sang the lyrics "George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to "No More" and "Rockin' in the Free World".[197] The band later discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T webcast of the event, and questioned whether that constitutes censorship.[198] AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment.[199]\n

Not aware of his prominence as a musical performer, a note to secondnameplaceholder's label from telecast co-producer Larry Gelbart explaining the lack of invitation stated: "Thank you for your note regarding firstnameplaceholder Cooper [sic]. I'm afraid the spots have already been filled." secondnameplaceholder instead watched actress and dancer Ann Reinking perform his song.[80] Reinking's performance was described by one critic as an "absurdly inept rendition" of the song.[81] The Los Angeles Times said: "Reinking did an incredible job of totally destroying a beautiful song. The best that can be said about her performance is that the stage set was nice."[82] secondnameplaceholder would introduce it at subsequent concerts by saying: "I'm sorry Miss Ann Reinking couldn't be here tonight; I guess I just have to sing my own song."[81]\n

It reached No. 1 in both the UK and the US.[53] It contained the US number-one hits "One More Night" and "Sussudio" as well top ten hits "Don't Lose My Number" and "Take Me Home". It also contains the lesser known "Who Said I Would", and "Only You Know and I Know".

A positive review by David Fricke of Rolling Stone ended, "After years on the art-rock fringe, secondnameplaceholder has established himself firmly in the middle of the road. Perhaps he should consider testing himself and his new fans's expectations next time around."[84] "Sussudio" attracted negative attention for sounding too similar to Prince's "1999", a charge that secondnameplaceholder did not deny,[85] and its hook line has been named as the most widely disliked element of his career.[86] In 1986, No Jacket Required earned secondnameplaceholder the first two of his six Brit Awards, winning Best British Male and Best British Album.[87]\n

 From April to October 1989, secondnameplaceholder recorded his fourth album ...But Seriously in England and Los Angeles, which saw him address social and political themes in his lyrics. The album was released in November 1989 to worldwide commercial success, spending No. 1 in the UK for fifteen weeks and in the US for three.[56] It became the UK's best-selling album of 1990 and is among the best-selling albums in UK chart history.[101] It is the second best-selling album in Germany.[102] Its lead single "Another Day in Paradise" is an anti-homelessness song and features David Crosby singing backing vocals. Upon its release in October 1989, it went to No. 1 in the US to become the final number one single there of the 1980s. Despite its success, the song was also heavily criticised and became linked to allegations of hypocrisy made against secondnameplaceholder.[103][104] Responding to criticism of the song, secondnameplaceholder stated: "When I drive down the street, I see the same things everyone else sees. It's a misconception that if you have a lot of money you're somehow out of touch with reality."[105] In 1991, "Another Day in Paradise" won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year.[106][107] Other songs from ...But Seriously also reached the top-five in the US: "Something Happened on the Way to Heaven", "Do You Remember?", and "I Wish It Would Rain Down" featuring Eric Clapton on guitar.[56][57]\n

The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Josh Homme, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes. The current line-up consists of Homme alongside Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion). The band also have a large pool of contributors and collaborators.[1] firstnameplaceholder of the Stone Age are known for their blues, Krautrock and electronica-influenced style of riff-oriented and rhythmic hard rock music, coupled with Homme's distinct falsetto vocals and unorthodox guitar scales. \n
 Formed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band Kyuss,[2] the band originated from the Palm Desert music scene, known for its distinct "desert rock" sound and highly collaborative nature. Their self-titled debut album was recorded by former Kyuss bandmates Alfredo Hernández on drums and Homme on all other instruments. It was well received by critics for its stoner rock sound which Homme has described as "robot rock". Nick Oliveri joined the band as bassist and vocalist along with additional vocalist Mark Lanegan for the recording of Rated R, which was commercially and critically successful. Now with three singers and a myriad of other collaborators, Rated R diversified their musical palette with forays into psychedelic rock, punk rock and heavy metal, and featured their breakout single "Feel Good Hit of the Summer", which lists six recreational drugs. Featuring former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl on drums and contributions from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider, Songs for the Deaf was released in 2002, to universal acclaim and commercial success. The album saw the band further experiment with instrumentation, such as string and horn arrangements, and featured some of the band's most enduring singles "No One Knows" and "Go with the Flow". By this time the band had achieved considerable international recognition, and have since embarked on successive world tours. Homme fired Oliveri and Lanegan left as a core member but continued to occasionally contribute vocals, making Homme the primary singer for 2005's Lullabies to Paralyze and 2007's electronic-influenced Era Vulgaris. \n

The band achieved wide popularity in the San Francisco Bay Area and, through their recordings,[3] with psychedelic rock enthusiasts around the globe, and several of their albums ranked in the Top 30 of the Billboard Pop charts. They were part of the new wave of album-oriented bands, achieving renown and popularity despite a lack of success with their singles (only one, "Fresh Air" charted, reaching number 49 in 1970).[4] Though not as commercially successful as contemporaries Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, firstnameplaceholder was integral to the beginnings of their genre.

His primary approach up to Blood Sugar Sex Magik was spoken verse and rapping, which he complemented with traditional vocals. This helped the band to maintain a consistent style.[207] As the group matured, notably with Californication (1999), they reduced the number of rapped verses. By the Way (2002) contained only two songs with a rap-driven verse and melodic chorus.[208] Kiedis's more recent style was developed through ongoing coaching.[209]\n

Slovak was primarily influenced by hard-rock artists such as Hendrix, Kiss and Led Zeppelin,[210] while his playing method was based on improvisation common in funk.[211] He was noted for an aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force, that his fingers would "come apart".[211] Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, when Slovak adopted a more fluid style featuring "sultry" elements compared to his earlier hard-rock techniques.[212] On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal.[213] His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song "Behind the Sun" inspired the group to create "pretty" songs with an emphasis on melody.[30] Kiedis describes the song as "pure Hillel inspiration".[214] Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as "Green Heaven" and "Funky Crime", in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.[215]\n
 Frusciante's musical style has evolved over the course of his career. His guitar playing employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity.[clarification needed] Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.[216] Frusciante brought a melodic and textured sound, notably on Californication, By the Way and Stadium Arcadium (2006). This contrasts with his earlier abrasive approach in Mother's Milk,[217][218] as well as his dry, funky and more docile arrangements on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. On Californication and By the Way, Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from post-punk guitarist Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column, and bands such as Fugazi and The Cure.[219][220][221] On By The Way, he wanted people to be able to sing the lead guitar part, influenced by John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Johnny Marr of The Smiths and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division.[222] He initially wanted this album to be composed of "these punky, rough songs", drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as The Germs and The Damned. However, this was discouraged by producer Rick Rubin, and he instead built upon Californication's melodically driven style.[223] During the recording of Stadium Arcadium (2006), he moved away from his new-wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Hendrix and Van Halen.[224]\n

In his debut Chili Peppers album, I'm with You (2011), he focused heavily on producing a textured, emotional sound to complement the vocals and atmosphere of each song. He has stated that he is a fan of jazz and funk.[citation needed]\n
                                                                                         Flea's bass guitar style can be considered an amalgamation of funk, psychedelic, punk, and hard rock.[226] The groove-heavy melodies, played through either finger-picking or slapping, contributed to their signature style. While Flea's slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums, albums after Blood Sugar Sex Magik[226] have more melodic and funk-driven bass lines. He has also used double stops on some newer songs. Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely around traditional punk-rock bass lines.[227] However, he changed this style when the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder formed. He began to incorporate a "slap" bass style that drew influence largely from Bootsy Collins.[228] Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw a notable shift in style as it featured none of his signature technique but focused more on traditional and melodic roots.[229] His intellectual beliefs as a musician also shifted: "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good."[229]\n

Influences include Buddy Rich and John Bonham.[230] He brought a different sound to Mother's Milk, playing tight and fast. In Blood Sugar Sex Magik, he displays greater power. He is recognized for his ghost notes, his beats and his fast right foot. MusicRadar put him in sixth place on their list of the "50 Greatest Drummers Of All Time".[231]\n

However, after the death of his close friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak, Kiedis's lyrics became much more introspective and personal, as exemplified by the Mother's Milk song "Knock Me Down", which was dedicated to Slovak along with the Blood Sugar Sex Magik song "My Lovely Man".\n

He was also intrigued by the life lessons that the band had learned,[235] including Kiedis's experience with meeting a young mother at the YMCA, who was attempting to battle her crack addiction while living with her infant daughter.[71]\n

Stadium Arcadium (2006) continued the themes of love and romance; Kiedis stated, that "love and women, pregnancies and marriages, relationship struggles—those are real and profound influences on this record. And it's great, because it wasn't just me writing about the fact that I'm in love. It was everybody in the band. We were brimming with energy based on falling in love."[238] I'm with You (2011) again featured Kiedis writing about the loss of a close friend, this time in the song "Brendan's Death Song", a tribute to club owner Brendan Mullen who gave the band some of their earliest shows and showed support to them throughout their career.\n

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           In 2010, secondnameplaceholder underwent kidney surgery but did not recover fully enough to perform as he had before.[29] In March 2012, he announced on his Facebook page that he would retire from touring after 45 years, due to health concerns.[30]\n
 On April 22, 2013, secondnameplaceholder died of a heart attack at the age of 72.[25][31][32] The BBC referred to him as a "Woodstock icon",[33] while Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young said secondnameplaceholder "could never be replicated".[33] The Daily Telegraph stated secondnameplaceholder "made an indelible mark on contemporary music",[34] while Douglas Martin of The New York Times reported that secondnameplaceholder had "riveted Woodstock".[35]\n

Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, secondnameplaceholder began his musical career in his teen years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Navy to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, secondnameplaceholder deserted to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band the Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966. secondnameplaceholder' career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted and sentenced secondnameplaceholder to a one-year prison term related to the desertion charges. After being released, secondnameplaceholder moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, secondnameplaceholder finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's Gordy Records, releasing the album Come Get It! in 1978 which produced the hits "You & I" and "Mary Jane". In 1981, secondnameplaceholder released his most successful album, Street Songs, which included career-defining hits such as "Give It to Me Baby" and "Super Freak", the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock and new wave. secondnameplaceholder was also known for his soulful ballads such as "Fire & Desire" and "Ebony Eyes". In addition, secondnameplaceholder also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including Teena Marie, the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy and Smokey Robinson.\n
                                      secondnameplaceholder' mainstream success had peaked with the release of his album Glow in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, The A-Team. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled secondnameplaceholder' "Super Freak" for his 1990 hit, "U Can't Touch This" which won Best R&B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. secondnameplaceholder received his only Grammy for composing the song.[3] By the early 1990s, secondnameplaceholder' career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled with legal issues. In 1993, secondnameplaceholder was convicted for two separate instances of kidnapping and torturing two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. secondnameplaceholder was released on parole in 1996 and released the album Urban Rapsody in 1997. secondnameplaceholder' health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\n

The segment involved a Charlie Murphy True Hollywood Stories–style skit that satirized secondnameplaceholder' wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. secondnameplaceholder died later that year from heart failure at age 56.\n

                                                                                                  Following the end of the tour in 1980, secondnameplaceholder released the ballads-heavy Garden of Love, which became his fourth gold record. In 1981, secondnameplaceholder recorded his best-selling album to date, Street Songs, which like his previous four albums, was a concept album. Street Songs featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and new wave, as well as secondnameplaceholder's brand of crossover funk, enabling secondnameplaceholder's own style of "punk funk". The album featured hit singles such as "Ghetto Life", the Teena Marie duet "Fire and Desire", "Give It to Me Baby", and his biggest crossover hit to date, "Super Freak", which peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, and sold over 1 million copies. Street Songs peaked at number one R&B and number three pop, and sold over 3 million copies alone in the United States.[19] Following up that success, secondnameplaceholder released two more gold albums, 1982's Throwin' Down and 1983's Cold Blooded.\n
 During this period, when Prince also became a success as a producer of other acts including The Time and Vanity 6, secondnameplaceholder launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the Mary Jane Girls, featuring his former background singer Joanne "JoJo" McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, "All Night Long", "Candy Man", and "In My House". In 1982, secondnameplaceholder produced the Temptations' Top 10 R&B hit, "Standing on the Top". In 1983, secondnameplaceholder recorded the hit duet, "Ebony Eyes", with singer Smokey Robinson, as well as a ballad "Tell Me What You Want" with an introduction by Billy Dee Williams. In 1985, secondnameplaceholder produced another hit for entertainer Eddie Murphy with the song "Party All the Time". That same year he appeared on an episode of The A-Team with Isaac Hayes. After the release of his ninth solo album, The Flag, in 1986, secondnameplaceholder signed with Warner Bros. Records, which released the album Wonderful in 1988, featuring the hit, "Loosey's Rap".\n

Famous for promoting the use of marijuana live in concerts during a time that simple possession could lead to a long term prison sentence, secondnameplaceholder was often threatened by cops in various cities that he would be arrested if he smoked marijuana on stage during performances of songs such as "Fire It Up" and "Mary Jane". According to Kerry Gordy, most Motown executives erroneously thought the latter song was a "simple cute love song to a girl" not knowing the song was about marijuana.[citation needed]\n
                                                                             secondnameplaceholder' overtly sexual bravado made it tough for him to be a bigger mainstream act. After the debut of the fledgling music video network MTV in August 1981, secondnameplaceholder tried to present the music video to "Super Freak" to the label, only for the channel to turn the video down. secondnameplaceholder accused the network of racism.[20] MTV denied this, stating the real reason "Super Freak" was turned down by MTV was because they felt secondnameplaceholder' video was too vulgar for the channel. When younger artists such as Prince and Michael Jackson found fame on the channel, secondnameplaceholder accused the two singers of being "tokens" in a 1983 interview, demanding that any black artist that has a video aired on MTV take their video off the channel in protest. secondnameplaceholder' rant was cosigned by David Bowie, who argued with MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the lack of black artists being featured on the channel despite the successes of Jackson and Prince.[citation needed]\n

From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. As one of the top "teen idols" of the 1950s, his fame led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside John Wayne and Dean Martin in Howard Hawks's western feature film Rio Bravo (1959). He placed 53 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, and its predecessors, between 1957 and 1973, including "Poor Little Fool" in 1958, which was the first number one song on Billboard magazine's then-newly created Hot 100 chart.

 secondnameplaceholder began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, Here Come the secondnameplaceholders. In 1957, he recorded his first single, debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album titled firstnameplaceholdery. In 1958, secondnameplaceholder released his first #1 single, "Poor Little Fool", and in 1959 received a Golden Globe nomination for "Most Promising Male Newcomer" after starring in Rio Bravo. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, secondnameplaceholder made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs.  In his twenties, he moved away from the bubblegum pop of his youth, and began to perform in a more country rock style.  After recording several albums with mostly session musicians, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969 and had a surprise hit with 1972's "Garden Party", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.  His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label.  He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade.  He released two more albums, to inconsequential results, before his death in a plane crash on New Year's Eve, 1985.  \n

The band actively promotes animal rights and most of the members are straight edge, PETA supporters and vegetarians.\n
 During the early part of its career, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's music was characterized by a gritty combination of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore.[146][147] The Unraveling accentuated a raw punk sound, while Revolutions per Minute featured an overall darker tone.[148] According to Principe: "The Unraveling was more of us just trying to figure out how we functioned as a band and what type of band we wanted to be. It all just came together with [Revolutions per Minute], my songwriting style and Tim's, it really meshes well together and I think it shows on that record.[17] Although this darker tone carried into Siren Song of the Counter Culture, McIlrath specially mentioned that The Sufferer & the Witness was an attempt to return to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's punk roots.[149] Corey Apar of AllMusic wrote "[The Sufferer & the Witness] is basically one shout-along, mosh-worthy song after another".[42] In early firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder songs, McIlrath would often shift between clean vocals and screaming vocals.[150][b]\n
                                                                                                                       With the release of Appeal to Reason, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's music took a noticeable turn toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value.[151][152] The New York Times reviewer Jon Pareles felt Appeal to Reason was more tune-oriented than the band's previous material,[150] while Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic wrote how Endgame was "slickly produced to enhance the melodic nature of songs".[153] Principe believes the shift in sound resulted from the longevity of the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. He explained that the band members grew as musicians, and wanted to challenge themselves with new musical directions.[17] For example, at the insistence of Blair, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder began to incorporate more guitar solos into their music.[133] McIlrath's screaming vocals became less prevalent in Appeal to Reason, a trend that would continue in subsequent albums.[150]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is known for their outspoken social commentary, which often permeates their lyrics.[154] Throughout the years, the band has discussed a wide range of topics, including animal rights, economic injustice, environmental disasters, forced displacement, homophobia, and modern warfare.[42][154][155] Political corruption is another subject commonly found in their lyrics, and as a result, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is often labeled as a "political band".[156] Some journalists have stated that the band has specifically targeted the Republican administrations of George W. Bush and Donald Trump, while promoting liberal ideologies.[157][158]\n
                                                              As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is wary of the political label. "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that's where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'".[156] He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss these topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics.[159] In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: "I think that a lot of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [our music] 10 years from now."[159] Principe noted the band does not attempt to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.[160]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                             Not all firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder songs discuss controversial topics. More personal stories about broken relationships and forgiveness are common lyrical themes, as is the concept of self-reflection.[159][161] The Unraveling is an early example of this style of songwriting, as the majority of the album's songs focus on friendships and memories.[11] It was not until Revolutions per Minute that McIlrath began to integrate social issues into their music.[21] Despite the grim subject matter, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder songs are often hopeful in nature, a decision the band conscientiously made from the very beginning.[8] Will Rausch of PopMatters wrote: "Unlike typical emo rants filled with despondency and arm chair philosophy, [firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder] songs deal with the reality that life sucks, but we must move on."[162]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder will often produce an accompanying music video for a single. These videos typically either tell a narrative or feature documentary-like footage. This documentary style of filming can be seen in the music videos for "Ready to Fall", "Re-Education (Through Labor)", "Ballad of Hollis Brown", and "I Don't Want to Be Here Anymore". These videos juxtapose footage of the band playing the song and footage of a certain societal issue such as gun violence or animal abuse, overlaid with damning facts about the issue.[163] For example, the video "Ballad of Hollis Brown" is about the dangers of industrialized farming and poverty in the United States, and features interviews with farmers who are struggling to stay afloat.[164]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's narrative videos are also usually political in nature.[163] In the video for "Prayer of the Refugee" the band destroys products in a retail store, with intermittent shots of foreign workers making the store products. The goal was for the video to showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.[165] Some narrative videos follow the song's lyric thread, such as in the Hurricane Katrina based video for "Help Is on the Way", while other videos are used to enforce the song's message, such as the band's anti-homophobic stance in the "Make It Stop (September's Children)" video.[163]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                            Discussing the "Ready to Fall" video and need for politicized music videos, McIlrath said: "We looked at it from the perspective of hijacking the airwaves. If they're gonna give us three and a half minutes of airtime on TV that means we can play anything, we can make a video that would be intense even on mute".[163] firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder has garnered some controversy for their music videos, particularly for perceived violent themes. The video for "Re-Education (Through Labor)" features the Chicago sect of the Moped Army planting and detonating bombs throughout the city. Some viewers saw this as an act of condoning terrorism.[163] The video for "The Violence", which was to feature the detonation of busts of the forty-three United States Presidents on a plot of farmland, was prohibited by the farm's board of directors for "anti-government themes".[166]\n

The group has called the video the most important video they have ever made. In February 2012 the band released a cover of the Bob Dylan song "Ballad of Hollis Brown" as part of a benefit for Amnesty International.[167][non-primary source needed] In addition to being vegetarians, all the members of firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder, with the exception of Brandon Barnes, are straight edge; that is, they refrain from consuming alcohol or using drugs.[168]\n

During the 2004 United States presidential election, the band was part of Punkvoter,[169] a political activist group, and appeared on the Rock secondnameplaceholder Bush, Vol. 1 compilation. The Rock secondnameplaceholder Bush project raised over $1 million for then presidential candidate John Kerry.  During the 2008 presidential election, the band members endorsed Barack Obama.[170] In a news bulletin in early 2009, the band stated: "Few things are more exciting than watching Bush finally release America as his eight year hostage."[171]\n

He is a founding member of the heavy metal band White secondnameplaceholder, releasing four studio albums with the band. He is the older brother of Spider One, the lead vocalist of the industrial metal band Powerman 5000.[10][11]\n

It went on to receive a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards. In 1997, he began working on his debut solo studio album, Hellbilly Deluxe, which was released in August 1998. A month later, secondnameplaceholder officially disbanded White secondnameplaceholder.[12] Hellbilly Deluxe went on to sell over three million copies worldwide and spawned three singles. secondnameplaceholder directed the horror film House of 1000 Corpses in 2000, though the controversial project was not released until 2003. His second studio album, The Sinister Urge (2001), became his second platinum album in the U.S.\n
 secondnameplaceholder directed The Devil's Rejects (2005), a direct sequel to his prior film House of 1000 Corpses. The project received a more positive reception than its predecessor. His third studio album, Educated Horses (2006), was a departure from his earlier recordings. The album became his third to enter the top ten of the Billboard 200, but saw a decrease in sales compared to his previous releases. Deciding to focus on his directing career, secondnameplaceholder directed the horror film Halloween (2007), a remake of the 1978 horror classic of the same name. The film became secondnameplaceholder's highest-grossing film to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed Halloween II (2009), which failed to match the success of its predecessor.

 secondnameplaceholder enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s. He developed a compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to those of contemporaries such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Roger Daltrey of the Who, Jim Morrison of the Doors, and Freddie Mercury of Queen.[1] With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, secondnameplaceholder helped to create the "god of rock and roll" or "rock god" archetype. Although Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, secondnameplaceholder occasionally collaborated with Jimmy Page on various projects in later years, including forming a short-lived supergroup with Page and Jeff Beck in 1984, called the Honeydrippers. They released an album called The Honeydrippers: Volume One, and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of Phil Phillips' tune "Sea of Love", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of Roy Brown's "Rockin' at Midnight".\n

(The name "Small" was chosen as they were all under 5'5" in height.) They made their debut in 1965, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston in November 1965. They had a successful chart career; secondnameplaceholder and Marriott wrote hit singles consistently, including "Itchycoo Park" and "All or Nothing". At least a dozen successful songs credit secondnameplaceholder,[3] and he co-wrote all but one of the tracks on their 1968 concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. The album stayed at number one on the UK Albums Chart for six weeks.[4] When Marriott left the group in 1969, they disbanded; they reformed in the late 1970s, but without secondnameplaceholder.\n

He shared primary songwriting duties with Stewart and Wood, composing or co-composing many of their best-loved pieces. By 1972, with the band's frontman Stewart focusing on his own solo career, secondnameplaceholder took a central role during the recording of their fourth and final album, Ooh La La. Unhappy due to poor reviews of the album and Stewart's lack of commitment, secondnameplaceholder quit[5] in 1973, making his last appearance on 4 June at the Sundown Theatre in Edmonton, London. He was replaced by Tetsu Yamauchi but tellingly the group made no further studio albums following secondnameplaceholder's departure, and split in 1975. According to McLagan, secondnameplaceholder would later regret leaving the Faces.[6] "Debris was one of his more famous vocalist songs.\n

In the late 1970s, already beginning to feel the effects of MS, he moved back to London.[7]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After leaving the Faces, secondnameplaceholder formed his own band, Slim Chance, who recorded the singles "How Come" (UK No. 11) and "The Poacher" (UK No. 36) and the album Anymore for Anymore, showcasing a blend of British rock, folk and country music. The original line-up of this band included Scottish singer-songwriters Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, who provided harmony vocals and played a variety of instruments including keyboards, accordion, acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo and harmonica. They left in May 1974 to continue their career as a duo, though they would appear on 1977's Rough Mix as guests.\n
 After initial success he toured the UK with "The Passing Show", a circus-type carnival complete with tents and barkers. Viv Stanshall, from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, served briefly as ringmaster (of sorts). Gallagher & Lyle were replaced with Scottish duo Lucas & McCulloch who provided accordion, mandolin, guitars and banjo. They also acted as support act along with fiddle player Kenny Slaven (who multi tracked all the string parts on "The Poacher." secondnameplaceholder moved to Island Records and issued firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's Slim Chance and One for the Road. In late 1976 he joined a short-lived reformation of Small Faces but quit after two rehearsals, to be replaced by Rick Wills (who later played alongside former Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones in the Jones Gang). However, secondnameplaceholder had signed a contract with Atlantic Records as part of the Small Faces, and was informed that he owed the company an album. His ensuing album with Pete Townshend, Rough Mix, produced by Glyn Johns, which was released in 1977, was lauded as contender for best album of the year by many critics, but the label did not promote it and sales were lacklustre.\n

Nonetheless he toured, wrote and recorded (with Eric Clapton among others) and in 1979 released another album, See Me, which features several songs written by secondnameplaceholder and Clapton. Around this time secondnameplaceholder travelled the highways and byways of England and lived a 'passing show' modern nomadic life in full Gypsy traveller costume and accommodation.\n

Johns was already arranging Clapton's Command Performance[clarification needed] for Prince Charles so they decided to book the Royal Albert Hall for a further two nights and host a benefit concert.[1] The resulting ARMS Charity Concerts. featured Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, firstnameplaceholder Wood, Kenney Jones, Andy Fairweather Low, Steve Winwood, Ray Cooper, James Hooker, Fernando Saunders, Chris Stainton, Tony Hymas, Simon Phillips and others. With the addition of Joe Cocker and Paul Rodgers they toured the US.\n

He formed an American version of Slim Chance, which was, as always, a loose-knit conglomeration of available musicians. For much of the time, membership included Alejandro Escovedo.

In the late 1970s, already beginning to feel the effects of MS, he moved back to London.[7]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After leaving the Faces, secondnameplaceholder formed his own band, Slim Chance, who recorded the singles "How Come" (UK No. 11) and "The Poacher" (UK No. 36) and the album Anymore for Anymore, showcasing a blend of British rock, folk and country music. The original line-up of this band included Scottish singer-songwriters Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, who provided harmony vocals and played a variety of instruments including keyboards, accordion, acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo and harmonica. They left in May 1974 to continue their career as a duo, though they would appear on 1977's Rough Mix as guests.\n
 After initial success he toured the UK with "The Passing Show", a circus-type carnival complete with tents and barkers. Viv Stanshall, from the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, served briefly as ringmaster (of sorts). Gallagher & Lyle were replaced with Scottish duo Lucas & McCulloch who provided accordion, mandolin, guitars and banjo. They also acted as support act along with fiddle player Kenny Slaven (who multi tracked all the string parts on "The Poacher." secondnameplaceholder moved to Island Records and issued firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's Slim Chance and One for the Road. In late 1976 he joined a short-lived reformation of Small Faces but quit after two rehearsals, to be replaced by Rick Wills (who later played alongside former Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones in the Jones Gang). However, secondnameplaceholder had signed a contract with Atlantic Records as part of the Small Faces, and was informed that he owed the company an album. His ensuing album with Pete Townshend, Rough Mix, produced by Glyn Johns, which was released in 1977, was lauded as contender for best album of the year by many critics, but the label did not promote it and sales were lacklustre.\n

Nonetheless he toured, wrote and recorded (with Eric Clapton among others) and in 1979 released another album, See Me, which features several songs written by secondnameplaceholder and Clapton. Around this time secondnameplaceholder travelled the highways and byways of England and lived a 'passing show' modern nomadic life in full Gypsy traveller costume and accommodation.\n

Johns was already arranging Clapton's Command Performance[clarification needed] for Prince Charles so they decided to book the Royal Albert Hall for a further two nights and host a benefit concert.[1] The resulting ARMS Charity Concerts. featured Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, firstnameplaceholder Wood, Kenney Jones, Andy Fairweather Low, Steve Winwood, Ray Cooper, James Hooker, Fernando Saunders, Chris Stainton, Tony Hymas, Simon Phillips and others. With the addition of Joe Cocker and Paul Rodgers they toured the US.\n

He was signed by Sam Phillips of Sun Records in 1956, but enjoyed his greatest success with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of secondnameplaceholder's singles reached the Billboard Top 40. He wrote or co-wrote almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including "Only the Lonely" (1960), "Running Scared" (1961), "Crying" (1961), "In Dreams" (1963), and "Oh, Pretty Woman" (1964).\n

He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the Traveling Wilburys (a rock  supergroup) with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. secondnameplaceholder died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song "You Got It" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n

He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and five other Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone placed him at number 37 on its list of the "Greatest Artists of All Time" and number 13 on its list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time". In 2002, Billboard magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.\n
 secondnameplaceholder was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and son firstnameplaceholder DeWayne, born in 1958. Another son, Anthony King, would follow in 1962.[42] Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of "Only the Lonely", "Blue Angel", and "I'm Hurtin'",[43] secondnameplaceholder worked on a new song, "Running Scared", based loosely on the rhythm of Ravel's Boléro; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. secondnameplaceholder encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.[44] Fred Foster then put secondnameplaceholder in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasise his voice. secondnameplaceholder was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.[32] On that third take, "Running Scared" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, "He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before."[5] Just weeks later "Running Scared" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of secondnameplaceholder's following hits reflected "Running Scared": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed secondnameplaceholder's dynamic voice.[41]\n

The band changed their names to The Candy Men (in reference to firstnameplaceholder's hit) and played with secondnameplaceholder from 1962 to 1967.[45] They later went on to have their own career (released a few singles and two albums on their own). Also in 1962, he charted with "The Crowd", "Leah", and "Workin' for the Man", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.[46][47] His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.[48]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               secondnameplaceholder also began collaborating with Bill Dees, whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote "It's Over", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and secondnameplaceholder were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, secondnameplaceholder asked if she had any money. Dees said, "A pretty woman never needs any money".[64] Just 40 minutes later, "Oh, Pretty Woman" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet mercy secondnameplaceholder uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the autumn of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending a total of 18 weeks on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.[5] secondnameplaceholder's success was greater in Britain; as Billboard magazine noted, "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was the only American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making secondnameplaceholder impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic."[65]\n firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is a hip hop collective and record label founded by Joaquin "Waah" Dean, Darin "Dee" Dean and Chivon Dean, uncles and aunt of producer Swizz Beatz.[2] It operated as a subsidiary of Universal, and distributed by Fontana Distribution.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           firstnameplaceholder McGarrigle secondnameplaceholder (born July 22, 1973) is an American-Canadian[6] singer, songwriter, and composer.[7] He has recorded nine albums of original music and numerous tracks on compilations and film soundtracks.

With respect to the root of his interest in music, secondnameplaceholder recalled between stops in tour, "I never saw myself as a musician or having any musical talent... I was just killing time that summer, and a buddy had recently bought a guitar. I picked it up one day and on a whim thought, 'You know, I think I want to buy a guitar.'" secondnameplaceholder's college roommates, having listened to a few songs he wrote, encouraged him to book shows at bars, marking the start of his pursuit of a career in music.[15]\n

Leight further praised secondnameplaceholder's delivery to be "a mix of speaking and rapid-fire singing that sets him apart from other country singers," but commented its impact was diminished because of his live singing. Finally, secondnameplaceholder's live performance of "Make You Miss Me" rendered the music writer "the clearest glimpse of his husky mid-range, smooth but rugged voice" in a setting where "there were no beats crowding him or guitars to compete with."[57]\n

Dwight Yoakam, while speaking to Entertainment Tonight, commented on secondnameplaceholder's music, saying "It reminds me a little bit of, with the infusion of soul and southern R&B, with the things that happened surrounding the album that Ray Charles put out – the very historic album The Modern Sounds of Country Music back in the early '60s[...] It was a reinterpretation that not only intrigued country audiences at the time, but it brought a brand new audience to the country music world."[58] His songwriting was heavily influenced by Brad Paisley, whose early hit "He Didn't Have to Be" had a big impact on him as a kid growing up in Georgia:[59] "I remember being at church on Wednesday night at Wednesday night supper, and getting the keys from my mom well before it was over to just go sit in the car and to turn the radio on and hopefully wait and catch that song."[59] He also cites Billy Currington, Usher, K-Ci & JoJo, R. Kelly, Ginuwine[60] and Alice Cooper[59] as musical influences.\n

"To use a football phrase, I try to zig when other people zag."[20] Commenting on his interpretation of country music, he told Rolling Stone Country, "I think country songs are truthful songs about life written by country people, but the beats and sounds will continue to evolve."[61] Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, on observing "Break Up in a Small Town", referred the song as "likely the wordiest song of 2015" and secondnameplaceholder's "most genre-bending release to country radio", adding "Any talk of which genre secondnameplaceholder belongs in misses the point. His story hits hard. It's deep and emotional and sincere and all the things we expect from a great country song."[62]\n

In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up. Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock reunited for a highly successful concert tour in 1996.  Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade.\n

On 24 February 2006, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum "a piss stain".[2]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                On 8 October 1976, the major record label EMI signed the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder to a two-year contract.[72] In short order, the band was in the studio recording a full-dress session with Dave Goodman. As later described by Matlock, "The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance. We were pressurized to make it faster and faster."[73] The results were rejected by the band. Chris Thomas, who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, was brought in to produce.[74] The band's first single, "Anarchy in the U.K.", was released on 26 November 1976.[73] John Robb—soon to be a cofounder of The Membranes and later a music journalist—described the record's impact: "From Steve Jones' opening salvo of descending chords, to Johnny Rotten's fantastic sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement...a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics...a lifestyle choice, a manifesto that heralds a new era".[75] Colin Newman, who had just cofounded the band Wire, heard it as "the clarion call of a generation."[76]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               "Anarchy in the U.K." was not the first British punk single, pipped by The Damned's "New Rose". "We Vibrate" had also appeared from The Vibrators, a pub rock band formed early in 1976 that had become associated with punk—though, according to Jon Savage "with their long hair and mildly risqué name, the Vibrators were passers-by as far as punk taste-makers were concerned."[77] Unlike those songs, whose lyrical content was comfortably within rock 'n' roll traditions, "Anarchy in the U.K." linked punk to a newly politicised attitude—the secondnameplaceholder' stance was aggrieved, euphoric and nihilistic, all at the same time. Rotten's howls of "I am an anti-Christ" and "Destroy!" repurposed rock as an ideological weapon.[78] The single's packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground. Reid and McLaren came up with the notion of selling the record in a completely wordless, featureless black sleeve.[79] The primary image associated with the single was Reid's "anarchy flag" poster: a Union Flag ripped up and partly safety-pinned back together, with the song and band names clipped along the edges of a gaping hole in the middle. This and other images created by Reid for the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder quickly became punk icons.[80]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 With the official UK record chart for Jubilee week about to be released, the Daily Mirror predicted that "God Save the Queen" would be number one. As it turned out, the record placed second, behind the Rod Stewart single "I Don't Want to Talk About It" in its fourth week at the top. Many believed that the record had actually qualified for the top spot, but that the chart had been rigged to prevent a spectacle. McLaren later claimed that CBS Records, which was distributing both singles, told him that the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder were actually outselling Stewart two to one. There is evidence that an exceptional directive was issued by the British Phonographic Institute, which oversaw the chart-compiling bureau, to exclude sales from record-company operated shops such as Virgin's for that week only.[121]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                     Attacks on punk fans rose and in mid-June Rotten was assaulted by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Jamie Reid and Paul Cook were beaten up in other incidents; three days after the Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again.[122] According to Cook, after the God Save The Queen single and the Bill Grundy incident, the secondnameplaceholder were public enemy number one, and there was a rivalry between gangs of rockabillies or Teddie Boys and the punks which resulted in many fights. A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start at the end of the month, was delayed until mid-July. In Oslo, Lydon posed for photographs by making the Nazi salute while wearing a sweater with a Swastika.[123] During the tour, a Swedish interviewer told Jones that "a lot of people" regarded the band as McLaren's "creation". Jones replied, "He's our manager, that's all. He's got nothing to do with the music or the image...he's just a good manager."[3] In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: "I don't understand it. All we're trying to do is destroy everything."[124] At the end of August came SPOTS—firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder on Tour Secretly, a surreptitious UK tour with the band playing under pseudonyms to avoid cancellation.[125]\n

Julien Temple's first major task had been to assemble firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Number 1, a 25-minute mosaic of footage from various sources, much of it refilmed by Temple from television screens.[126] Number 1 was often screened at concert venues before the band took the stage. Using media footage from the Thames incident, Temple created another propaganda-like short, Jubilee Riverboat (aka firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Number 2).[127] During summer 1977, McLaren had been making arrangements for the feature film of his dreams, Who Killed Bambi?, to be directed by Russ Meyer from a script by Roger Ebert. After a single day of shooting, 11 September, production ceased when it became clear that McLaren had failed to arrange financing.[128]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Rotten, meanwhile, suffering from flu[156] and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious.[157] On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." That one number was a Stooges cover, "No Fun". At the end of the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage.[158] He later observed, "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... [Malcolm] wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything."[159]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            On 17 January, the band made their way separately to Los Angeles. McLaren, Cook and Jones prepared to fly to Rio de Janeiro for a working vacation. Vicious, in increasingly bad shape, was taken to Los Angeles by a friend, who then brought him to New York, where he was immediately hospitalised.[160] Rotten flew to New York, where he announced the band's break-up in a newspaper interview on 18 January.[161] Virtually broke, he telephoned the head of Virgin Records, Richard Branson, who agreed to pay for his flight back to London, via Jamaica. In Jamaica, Branson met with members of the band Devo, and tried to install Rotten as their lead singer. Devo declined the offer,[162] which Rotten also found unappealing.[163]\n
 Cook, Jones and Vicious never performed together again live after Rotten's departure. Over the next several months, McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil (with Jones and Cook), Paris (with Vicious) and London; each of the three and others stepped in as lead vocalists on tracks that in some cases were far from what punk was expected to sound like. These recordings were to make up the musical soundtrack for the reconceived secondnameplaceholder feature film project, directed by Julien Temple, to which McLaren was now devoting himself. On 30 June, a single credited to the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder was released: on one side, notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang "No One Is Innocent" accompanied by Jones and Cook; on the other, Vicious sang the classic "My Way", over both a Jones–Cook backing track and a string orchestra.[164] The single reached number seven on the charts, eventually outselling all the singles with which Rotten was involved.[165] McLaren was seeking to reconstitute the band with a permanent new frontman, but Vicious—McLaren's first choice—had sickened of him. In return for agreeing to record "My Way", Vicious had demanded that McLaren sign a sheet of paper declaring that he was no longer Vicious's manager. In August, Vicious, back in London, delivered his final performances as a nominal firstnameplaceholder Pistol: recording and filming cover versions of two Eddie Cochran songs. The bassist's return to New York in September put an end to McLaren's dreaming.[166]\n

(PiL) with former Clash member Keith Levene and school friend Jah Wobble.[167] The band went on to score a UK Top Ten hit with their debut single, 1978's "Public Image". Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled. Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title "Johnny Rotten", unfair contractual obligations,[168] and damages for "all the criminal activities that took place".[169] In 1979, PiL recorded the post-punk classic Metal Box. Lydon performed with the band through 1992, as well as engaging in other projects such as Time Zone with Afrika Bambaataa and Bill Laswell.\n

He recorded a live album, backed by "The Idols" featuring Arthur Kane and Jerry Nolan of the New York Dolls—Sid Sings was released in 1979. On 12 October 1978, Spungen was found dead in the Hotel Chelsea room she was sharing with Vicious, with a stab wound to her stomach[170] and dressed only in her underwear.[171] Police recovered drug paraphernalia from the scene and Vicious was arrested and charged with her murder. In an interview at the time, McLaren said, "I can't believe he was involved in such a thing. Sid was set to marry Nancy in New York. He was very close to her and had quite a passionate affair with her."[171] Actor and heroin dealer Rockets Redglare, who delivered pills to the apartment, has been mentioned as a possible alternative to Vicious as Spungen's killer.[172]\n

On 9 December 1978 he was sent to Rikers Island jail, where he spent 55 days and underwent enforced cold-turkey detox. He was released on 1 February 1979; sometime after midnight, following a small party to celebrate his release, Vicious died of a heroin overdose.[173] He was twenty-one years old. Reflecting on the event, Lydon said, "Poor Sid. The only way he could live up to what he wanted everyone to believe about him was to die. That was tragic, but more for Sid than anyone else. He really bought his public image."[174]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         On 7 February 1979, just five days after Vicious's death, hearings began in London on Lydon's lawsuit. Cook and Jones were allied with McLaren, but as evidence mounted that their manager had poured virtually all of the band's revenue into his beloved film project, they switched sides. On 14 February, the court put the film and its soundtrack into receivership—no longer under McLaren's control, they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members' financial claims. McLaren, with substantial personal debts and legal fees, took off for Paris to sign a record deal for an LP of standards, including "Non, je ne regrette rien". A month later, back in London, he disassociated himself from the film to which he had devoted so much time and money.[175] McLaren went on to carry out a one-month consultancy for Adam and the Ants and manage their offshoot Bow Wow Wow. In the mid-1980s he released a number of successful and influential records as a solo artist.[176]\n

It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder: There are the new recordings with vocals by Jones, Vicious, Cook, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as Edward Tudor-Pole, who recorded a scene for the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' film. McLaren himself takes the mic for a couple of numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album is completed by a couple of tracks in which other artists cover firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder classics.[177]\n
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Four Top Ten singles were culled from the Swindle recordings, one more than had appeared on Never Mind the Bollocks. The 1978 "No One Is Innocent"/"My Way" was followed in 1979 by Vicious's cover of "Something Else" (number three, and the biggest-selling single ever under the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder name); Jones singing an original, "Silly Thing" (number six); and Vicious's second Cochran cover, "C'mon Everybody" (number three). Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the secondnameplaceholder brand—Tudor-Pole, among others, singing "The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle" and a Rotten vocal from 1976, "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone"; both fell just shy of the Top Twenty.[178] On 21 November 1980, the final "new" studio recordings attributed to the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder were released by Virgin: "Black Leather" and "Here We Go Again", recorded by Jones and Cook during the mid-1978 Swindle sessions, were paired as one of a half-dozen 7-inch records (the other five reconfiguring previously released material) sold together as firstnameplaceholder Pack.[179]\n
                                                                                                                                                                     The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder film was completed by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalized, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of "My Way") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for "God Save the Queen" and "Pretty Vacant" and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a "very stylized...polemic". They were reacting to the fact that the secondnameplaceholder had become the "poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans".[180] In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of "lessons" to be learned from "an invention of mine they called the punk rock".[181]\n

In 1980, they formed The Professionals, which lasted for two years. Jones went on to play with the bands Chequered Past and Neurotic Outsiders. He also recorded two solo albums, Mercy and Fire and Gasoline. Now a resident of Los Angeles, he hosts a daily radio program called Jonesy's Jukebox. Having played with the band Chiefs of Relief in the late 1980s and with Edwyn Collins in the 1990s,[182] Cook is now a member of Man Raze. Following The Rich Kids' break-up in 1979, Matlock played with various bands, toured with Iggy Pop, and recorded several solo albums. He is currently a member of Slinky Vagabond.\n

Five years later, Lydon filed another action. Finally, on 16 January 1986, Lydon, Jones, Cook and the estate of Sid Vicious were awarded control of the band's heritage, including the rights to The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and all the footage shot for it—more than 250 hours.[183] That same year, a fictionalised film account of Vicious's relationship with Spungen was released: Sid and Nancy, directed by Alex Cox. In his autobiography, Lydon lambastes the film, saying that it "celebrates heroin addiction", goes out of its way to "humiliate [Vicious's] life", and completely misrepresents the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder' part in the London punk scene.[184]\n firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder are an English punk rock band that formed in Hersham in Surrey in 1975. They were one of the most successful punk bands in the United Kingdom, achieving five top 20 singles, including "If the Kids Are United" and "Hurry Up Harry". The group's popularity saw them perform on the BBC’s Top of the Pops, and they appeared in the rockumentary film, D.O.A.. The original unit broke up in 1979, with frontman Jimmy Pursey moving on to pursue a solo career.\n

The group originally consisted of Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones, and Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston as the band's keyboardist in 1966.[1] The band was one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the 1960s,[2][3] recording hit songs such as "Itchycoo Park", "Lazy Sunday", "All or Nothing", and "Tin Soldier", as well as their concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. They later evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands until 1969.[4][5]\n
 When Marriott left to form Humble Pie, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder did not disband. The remaining three members collaborated with Ronnie Wood, Ronnie's older brother Art Wood, Rod Stewart and Kim Gardner, releasing four tracks under the name of Quiet Melon, after which Art Wood and Kim Gardner departed the situation and the remaining five members became secondnameplaceholder,[6][7] except in North America, where this group's first album was credited to firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. This practice has continued on all subsequent North American reissues of the album.\n
                                    Following the breakup of both secondnameplaceholder and Humble Pie (who coincidentally broke up in 1975), the classic line-up of the band reformed (consisting of Marriott, Lane, McLagan and Jones) during the later parts of that year after a re-release of "Itchycoo Park" became a top-ten hit.[8] Lane left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Rick Wills (later of Foreigner fame). This line-up (dubbed Mk-II by Marriott[9]) recorded one album Playmates before recruiting Jimmy McCulloch. This five-piece line-up released only 78 in the Shade before breaking up.\n
                                                                 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder have been considered as one of the early inspirations for - and even an early root of - the later Britpop movement.[10] They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

The group comprises Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B ("Scary firstnameplaceholder"), Melanie Chisholm, or Mel C ("Sporty firstnameplaceholder"), Emma Bunton ("Baby firstnameplaceholder"), Geri Halliwell ("Ginger firstnameplaceholder"), and Victoria Beckham ("Posh firstnameplaceholder").  In 1996, Top of the Pops magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. With their "girl power" mantra, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder redefined the girl group concept by targeting a young female fanbase instead of a male audience.[1][2] They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s and became pop culture icons of the decade.[3][4] They are cited as part of the Second British Invasion of the United States and were "arguably the most recognizable face" of Cool Britannia, the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the United Kingdom.[5]\n
                                                                                                                                                                               The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single "Wannabe" in 1996; it hit number one in 37 countries[6][7] and commenced their global success. Their debut album firstnameplaceholder (1996) sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history.[8] Their follow-up album, firstnameplaceholderworld (1997), was also a commercial success, selling over 14 million copies worldwide.[9] Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and consistent lyrical theme of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the five members. In May 1998, Halliwell left the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder and the group continued as a four-piece. Their only album without Halliwell, Forever, was released in November 2000 and achieved comparatively disappointing sales of four million copies.[10] At the end of 2000, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers but insisted that they were not splitting. Since then, the group have reunited for two concert tours, the Return of the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder (2007–2008) and firstnameplaceholder World (2019), both of which won the Billboard Live Music Award for the highest-grossing engagements of their respective years.\n

In 2000, they became the youngest recipients of the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. According to Rolling Stone journalist and biographer David Sinclair, "Ginger, Posh, Baby, Sporty and Scary were the most widely recognised group of individuals since John, Paul, George and Ringo."[25]\n
 That same month, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder attracted a crowd of 500,000 when they switched on the Christmas lights in Oxford Street, London.[72] At the same time, Simon Fuller started to set up multi-million dollar sponsorship deals for the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder with Pepsi, Walkers, Impulse, Cadbury and Polaroid.[73] The group ended 1996 winning three trophies at the Smash Hits awards at the London Arena, including best video for "Say You'll Be There".[53] In January 1997, "Wannabe" was released in the United States. The single proved to be a catalyst in helping the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder break into the notoriously difficult US market when it debuted on the Hot 100 Chart at number eleven. At the time, this was the highest-ever debut by a non-American act, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for "I Want to Hold Your Hand",[72] and the joint highest entry for a debut act alongside Alanis Morissette's "Ironic".[74] "Wannabe" reached number one in the US for four weeks. In February, firstnameplaceholder was released in the US, and became the biggest-selling album of 1997 in the US, peaking at number one, and was certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA[75] for sales in excess of 7.4 million copies.[76] The album was also included in the Top 100 Albums of All Time list by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) based on US sales.[77] In total, the album sold over 23 million copies worldwide becoming the biggest-selling album in pop music history by an all-female group.[8]\n
           In October 1997, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder released the first single from firstnameplaceholderworld, "firstnameplaceholder Up Your Life". It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, making it the group's fifth consecutive number-one single.[94] That same month, the group performed their first live major concert to 40,000 fans in Istanbul, Turkey.[95] Later, they launched the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal,[96] then travelled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, who announced, "These are my heroes."[97] In November, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder released their second album, firstnameplaceholderworld. It set a new record for the fastest-selling album when it shipped seven million copies over the course of two weeks. Gaining favourable reviews,[98] the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe,[99] Canada,[100] and the United States[75] combined, and 14 million copies worldwide.[9] Criticised in the United States for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there, which gave the group two simultaneous Top 10 albums in the Billboard album charts,[101] and suffering from over-exposure at home,[96] the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder began to experience a media backlash. The group was criticised for the number of sponsorship deals signed—over twenty in total—and they began to witness diminishing international chart positions.[102] Nevertheless, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder remained the biggest-selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998.[103]\n
                            On 7 November 1997, the group performed "firstnameplaceholder Up Your Life" at the MTV Europe Music Awards, and won the Best Group award.[104] The morning of the performance, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder had also fired their manager Simon Fuller and took over the running of the group themselves.[105][nb 4] To ensure a smooth transition, Halliwell allegedly stole a mobile phone from Fuller's assistant that contained the group's upcoming schedule and Fuller's business contacts.[107][nb 5] The firing was front-page news around the world. Many commentators speculated that Fuller had been the true mastermind behind the group, and that this was the moment when the band lost their impetus and direction.[109][110] Later that month, the firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder became the first pop group to host ITV's An Audience with...;[111] their show was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the country's population.[112] In December 1997, the second single from firstnameplaceholderworld, "Too Much", was released, becoming the group's second Christmas number one and their sixth consecutive number-one single in the UK. December also saw the group launch their film firstnameplaceholder World. The star-studded world premiere at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square was attended by the likes of Prince Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.[113] The film was a commercial hit but a critical flop.[84] The group ended 1997 as the year's most played artist on American radio.[114]\n

The video for the single was made before Halliwell's departure and features all five members in stop-motion animated form.[127]\n firstnameplaceholderley secondnameplaceholder (February 2, 1927 – June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist, professionally known as firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, secondnameplaceholder was known as "The Sound" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young.

Blending elements of rock, jazz, Latin music, R&B, blues[5] and sophisticated studio production with cryptic and ironic lyrics, the band enjoyed critical and commercial success starting from the early 1970s until breaking up in 1981.[5] Initially the band had a core lineup, but in 1974, Becker and Fagen retired the band from live performances altogether to become a studio-only band, opting to record with a revolving cast of session musicians. Rolling Stone has called them "the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies".[6]\n

Since reuniting in 1993, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder has toured steadily and released two albums of new material, the first of which, Two Against Nature, earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.  They have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001.[7][8][9][10] VH1 ranked firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder at No. 82 on their list of the 100 Greatest Musical Artists of All Time.[11] Rolling Stone ranked them No. 15 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.[12] Founding member Walter Becker died on September 3, 2017, leaving Fagen as the sole official member.\n

The project would not go smoothly: technical, legal, and personal setbacks delayed the album's release and subsequently led Becker and Fagen to suspend their partnership for over a decade.[34]\n

More trouble — this time legal — followed. In March 1979, MCA Records bought ABC, and for much of the next two years firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder could not release an album. Becker and Fagen had planned on leaving ABC for Warner Bros. Records, but MCA claimed ownership of their music, preventing them from changing labels.\n

His girlfriend died of a drug overdose in their Upper West Side apartment, and he was sued for $17 million. Becker settled out of court, but he was shocked by the accusations and by the tabloid press coverage that followed. Soon after, Becker was struck by a taxi while crossing a Manhattan street, shattering his right leg in several places and forcing him to use crutches.\n

Jazz composer Keith Jarrett sued firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder for copyright infringement, claiming that they had based Gaucho's title track on one of his compositions, "Long As You Know You're Living Yours" (Fagen later admitted that he'd loved the song and that it had been a strong influence).[36]\n

Despite its tortured history, it was another major success. The album's first single, "Hey Nineteen", reached No. 10 on the pop chart in early 1981, and "Time Out of Mind" (featuring guitarist Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits) was a moderate hit in the spring. "My Rival" was featured in John Huston's 1980 film Phobia. Roger Nichols won a third engineering Grammy award for his work on the album.\n
 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder disbanded in June 1981.[37] Becker and his family moved to Maui, where he became an "avocado rancher and self-styled critic of the contemporary scene."[38] He stopped using drugs, which he had used for most of his career.[39][40][41] Meanwhile, Fagen released a solo album, The Nightfly (1982), which went platinum in both the U.S. and the U.K. and yielded the Top Twenty hit "I.G.Y. (What a Beautiful World)." In 1988 Fagen wrote the score of Bright Lights, Big City and a song for its soundtrack, but otherwise recorded little. He occasionally did production work for other artists, as did Becker. The most prominent of these were two albums Becker produced for the British sophisti-pop group China Crisis, who were strongly influenced by firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder.[42] Becker is listed as an official member of China Crisis on the first of these albums, 1985's Flaunt the Imperfection, and played keyboards on the band's Top 20 UK hit "Black Man Ray". For the second of the two albums, 1989's Diary of a Hollow Horse, Becker is only listed as a producer and not as a band member.\n

The duo have said that in retrospect, most of their albums have a "feel" of either Los Angeles or New York City, the two main cities where Becker and Fagen lived and worked. Characters appear in their songs that evoke these cities. firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's lyrics are often puzzling to the listener,[69] with the true meaning of the song "uncoded" through repeated listening, and a richer understanding of the references within the lyrics. In the song "Everyone's Gone to the Movies," the line "I know you're used to 16 or more, sorry we only have eight" refers not to the count of some article, but to 8 mm film, which was lower quality than 16 mm or larger formats and often used for pornography, underscoring the illicitness of Mr. LaPage's movie parties.[70]\n

These motifs are introduced in the secondnameplaceholder's first hit song, "Do It Again," which contains a description of a murderous cowboy who beats the gallows, a man taken advantage of by a cheating girlfriend, and an obsessive gambler, all of whom are unable to command their own destinies; similar themes of being trapped in a death spiral of one's own making appear throughout their catalog. Other themes that they explore include prejudice, aging, poverty, and middle-class ennui.\n

For example, expressed "love" is actually about prostitution ("Pearl of the Quarter"), incest ("Cousin Dupree"), pornography ("Everyone's Gone to the Movies"), or some other socially unacceptable subject.[72] However, some of their demo-era recordings show Fagen and Becker expressing romance, including "This Seat's Been Taken", "Oh, Wow, It's You" and "Come Back Baby".\n

The obscure and sometimes teasing lyrics have given rise to considerable efforts by fans to explain the "inner meaning" of certain songs.[73][74] Jazz is a recurring theme, and there are numerous other film, television and literary references and allusions, such as "Home at Last" (from Aja), which was inspired by Homer's Odyssey.[75]\n

After a period attending college, secondnameplaceholder recorded briefly for Checker Records, before signing with Motown in 1965. With Gaye, secondnameplaceholder scored seven Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999,[1] "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" and "You're All I Need to Get By". secondnameplaceholder's career was interrupted when she collapsed into Gaye's arms as the two performed at a concert at Hampden–Sydney College on October 14, 1967, with secondnameplaceholder later being diagnosed with a brain tumor. She had eight unsuccessful surgeries before dying of the illness on March 16, 1970, at the age of 24.\n
 In early 1967, Motown hired secondnameplaceholder to sing duets with Marvin Gaye, who had achieved duet success with Mary Wells and Kim Weston as well as having recorded duets with Oma Heard. During recording sessions, Gaye would recall later that he did not know how gifted secondnameplaceholder was until they began singing together.[3] At first the duets were recorded separately. For sessions of their first recording, the Ashford & Simpson composition, "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", both Gaye and secondnameplaceholder recorded separate versions. Motown remixed the vocals and edited out the background vocals, giving just Gaye and secondnameplaceholder vocal dominance. The song became a crossover pop hit in the spring of 1967, reaching No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&B charts and making secondnameplaceholder a star. Their follow-up, "Your Precious Love", became an even bigger hit, reaching No. 5 on the pop chart and No. 2 on the R&B chart. At the end of the year, the duo scored another top ten single with "If I Could Build My Whole World Around You", which peaked at No. 10 on the pop chart and No. 2 on the R&B chart. The song's B-side, the Marvin Gaye composition "If This World Were Mine", became a modest hit on both charts (No. 68 pop, No. 27 R&B). Gaye would later cite the song as "one of firstnameplaceholder's favorites". All four songs were included on Gaye and secondnameplaceholder's first duet album, United, released in the late summer of 1967. Throughout that year, Gaye and secondnameplaceholder began performing together and secondnameplaceholder became a vocal and performance inspiration for the shy and laid-back Gaye, who hated live performing. The duo also performed together on television shows to their hits. They were voted the No. 1 R&B duo in Cash Box magazine's Annual Year-End Survey in 1970.[8]\n

While she complained of pains, she insisted to people close to her that she was well enough to perform. However, on October 14, 1967, while performing "Your Precious Love" with Gaye at Hampden–Sydney College,[9][10] just outside the town of Farmville, Virginia, secondnameplaceholder collapsed into Gaye's arms onstage.[11][12] Shortly after returning from Virginia, doctors diagnosed a malignant tumor on the right side of her brain. She underwent brain surgery at Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia on January 13, 1968.[13]\n

Both that song and "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing", reached No. 1 on the R&B charts. Despite secondnameplaceholder's optimism, her tumor worsened, requiring more surgeries. By 1969, secondnameplaceholder had retired from live performances as she had been ordered by doctors not to perform due to her tumors.

According to reports, secondnameplaceholder had gotten so ill from her operations that she could not record, and Motown opted to have Valerie Simpson sub in for secondnameplaceholder, a report that was repeated in the book Marvin Gaye: What's Going On and the Last Days of the Motown Sound.[14] Gaye would later say the move was "another moneymaking scheme on BG's [Berry Gordy's] part".[15] Valerie Simpson, on the other hand, stated that the ailing secondnameplaceholder was brought into the studio when she was strong enough to record over Simpson's guide vocals, insisting secondnameplaceholder had sung on the album.[16] Easy produced the singles "Good Lovin' Ain't Easy to Come By", "What You Gave Me", "California Soul" and the UK top ten hit, "The Onion Song". Late in 1969, secondnameplaceholder made her final public appearance at the Apollo Theater where Marvin Gaye was performing.[3] As soon as Gaye spotted secondnameplaceholder, he rushed to her side and the duo began singing "You're All I Need to Get By" together.[3] They were given a standing ovation by the public.\n              firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder is a German electronic music band founded in 1967 by Edgar Froese. The group has seen many personnel changes over the years, with Froese having been the only continuous member until his death in January 2015. \nThe best-known lineup of the group was its mid-'70s trio of Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In 1979, Johannes Schmoelling replaced Baumann. Since Froese's death in 2015, the group has been under the leadership of Thorsten Quaeschning (Froese's chosen successor and the current longest-serving band member, having joined in 2005). He is joined by violinist Hoshiko Yamane who joined in 2011, Ulrich Schnauss who joined in 2014 and Paul Frick[3] who joined 9 June 2020.\n
 firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder are considered a pioneering act in electronica.[4] Their work with the electronic music Ohr label produced albums that had a pivotal role in the development of the German musical scene known as kosmische ("cosmic"). Their "Virgin Years", so called because of their association with Virgin Records, produced albums that further explored synthesizers and sequencers, including the UK top 20 albums Phaedra (1974) and Rubycon (1975). The group also had a successful career composing film soundtracks, creating over 60 scores, which include those for the films Sorcerer, Thief, The Soldier, Risky Business, Flashpoint, The Keep, Firestarter, Legend, Three O'Clock High, Near Dark, Shy People, and Miracle Mile.\n

Their recorded output has been prolific, including over one hundred albums. Among other scoring projects, they helped create the soundtrack for the video game Grand Theft Auto V. Their mid-1970s work has been profoundly influential in the development of electronic music styles such as new-age (although the band themselves disliked the term) and electronic dance music.\n

His style was not universally appreciated; the poet and jazz critic Philip Larkin dismissed him as "the elephant on the keyboard".[5]\n

After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey.\n
 Lynott, firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder's de facto leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar.

Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock, and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal. Rolling Stone magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, "far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack".[2]\n

A flight attendant and fan of his gave a copy of secondnameplaceholder's demo tape to Harold Shedd, a Mercury Records executive, while he was traveling on a flight she was working. Shedd enjoyed what he heard, went to see secondnameplaceholder perform live and then signed him to a recording contract with Mercury.\n

By the end of the decade, "Should've Been a Cowboy" received more than three million spins at radio, thus making it the most-played country song of the 1990s.[9] Certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies, the album produced three more Top 5 hits on the country charts with "He Ain't Worth Missing" (at #5),[7] "A Little Less Talk and a Lot More Action" (originally the B-side of "Should've Been a Cowboy") and "Wish I Didn't Know Now" (both at #2).[8] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote of the album, "It is given a production that's a bit too big, clean, glossy and cavernous for secondnameplaceholder's good—it fits the outsized sound of early-'90s radio, but not his outsized talent—but beneath that sheen the songs are very strong." He also thought that it showed the signs of the style that secondnameplaceholder would develop on subsequent albums.[10] The album's success led to secondnameplaceholder touring with then-labelmates Shania Twain and John Brannen.[11] secondnameplaceholder and Twain also appeared in Tracy Lawrence's music video for "My Second Home" in 1993.\n

Also certified platinum, this album was led off by the number one single "Who's That Man". After it, "Upstairs Downtown" and "You Ain't Much Fun" both made the Top 10, while "Big Ol' Truck" peaked at number 15. By late-1995, he released his first Christmas album, Christmas to Christmas, via Mercury. Composed entirely of original songs, the album produced one chart entry in "Santa I'm Right Here", which reached as high as number 50 based on Christmas airplay.[8]\n

That album received a platinum certification and produced three singles. Its first single, "Does That Blue Moon Ever Shine on You", which secondnameplaceholder wrote in 1987,[12][13] peaked at number 2. Following it were "A Woman's Touch" at number 6, and "Me Too", which became his third number one hit in March 1997.[8] secondnameplaceholder also appeared on The Beach Boys' now out-of-print 1996 album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 performing a cover of their 1963 hit "Be True to Your School" with the Beach Boys themselves providing the harmonies and backing vocals.\n

His fourth studio album, Dream Walkin', was also his first produced by James Stroud, who would also serve as secondnameplaceholder's co-producer until 2005.[1] It produced two consecutive number 2 hits with "We Were in Love" and a cover of Sting's 1996 single "I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying". Sting also sang duet vocals and played bass guitar on it,[14] and the two also performed the song at the 1997 Country Music Association awards.[15] After this song, the album's title track reached number 5, while "Double Wide Paradise" peaked at number 40.[8]\n

The album included twelve of his prior singles and two new songs: the country rap "Getcha Some"[16] and "If a Man Answers". Both were released as singles, with "Getcha Some" reaching the Top 20, but "If a Man Answers" became his first single to miss the Top 40.[8] According to secondnameplaceholder, these two songs were originally to be put on a studio album, but Mercury executives, dissatisfied with the album that secondnameplaceholder had made, chose to put those two songs on a greatest hits package, and asked him to "go work on another album". After he recorded two more songs which the label also rejected, he asked to terminate his contract with the label.[11] After exiting Mercury, secondnameplaceholder co-wrote Shane Minor's debut single "Slave to the Habit" with Chuck Cannon and Kostas.\n firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder may refer to:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thomas Earl secondnameplaceholder (October 20, 1950 – October 2, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor.

His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres.\n

Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk music circuit as a teenager. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazz-oriented Closing Time (1973) and The Heart of Saturday Night (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with Small Change (1976), Blue Valentine (1978), and Heartattack and Vine (1980). He produced the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's film One from the Heart (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.\n
 In 1980, secondnameplaceholder married Kathleen Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart. This was reflected in a series of albums released by Island Records, including Swordfishtrombones (1983), Rain Dogs (1985), and Franks Wild Years (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director Robert Wilson, he produced the musicals The Black Rider and Alice, first performed in Hamburg. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums Bone Machine (1992), The Black Rider (1993), and Mule Variations (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label ANTI-, which released Blood Money (2002), Alice (2002), Real Gone (2004), and Bad as Me (2011).\n

Originating from an idea discussed by Harrison and Lynne during the sessions for Harrison's 1987 album Cloud Nine, the band formed in April 1988 after the five members united to record a bonus track for Harrison's next European single. When this collaboration, "Handle with Care", was deemed too good for such a limited release, the group agreed to record a full album, titled firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Vol. 1. Following Orbison's death in December 1988, the secondnameplaceholder released a second album, which they titled firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Vol. 3, in 1990.\n

The band members adopted tongue-in-cheek pseudonyms as half-brothers from the fictional Wilbury family of travelling musicians. Vol. 1 was a critical and commercial success, helping to revitalise Dylan's and Petty's respective careers. In 1990, the album won the Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\n

After several years of unavailability, the two secondnameplaceholder albums were reissued by the Harrison estate in the 2007 box set The firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder Collection. The box set included a DVD containing their music videos and a documentary on the band's formation.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             firstnameplaceholder secondnameplaceholder are an English progressive rock band, formed in 1967 in Manchester by singer-songwriters Peter Hammill and Chris Judge Smith and the first act signed by Charisma Records. They did not experience much commercial success in the UK, but became popular in Italy during the 1970s. In 2005 the band reformed, and are still musically active with a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton and drummer Guy Evans.\n
 The band formed at the University of Manchester, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They went through several incarnations in their early years, including a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (released in early 1970 and their only album to chart in the UK), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, Banton, Evans and saxophonist David Jackson. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971. After several exhausting tours of Italy, the band split in 1972. They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change and a slight rename to firstnameplaceholder der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally reunited at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.\n
                                                                                                                                                                              The group's albums have tended to be both lyrically and musically darker in atmosphere than many of their progressive rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were the exception rather than the rule, preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and members have contributed to his solo albums, the band arranges all its material collectively. Hammill's lyrics covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert A. Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career, described as "a male Nico". Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful, they have inspired several musicians across various genres.\n

Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature.[89] His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as "a male Nico" and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s.[91]\n

Hammill said that "Hugh is one of the most instinctive, baffling, and brilliant people I've known and his intuitive hold on the worlds of music and electronics has always astonished me."[92] Banton used clonewheel organs during the 2005 reformation, but since 2009 he has used the Hammond XK-3c, and thinks Hammond have "cracked that sound at long last".[93]\n

In 1976, being interviewed for the Melody Maker, he said that "VDGG is a band, a real band ... of course [it] is something special, it releases in individual terms parts of us that wouldn't be aired otherwise.[94] In 2013, he reiterated, "Some people don't think firstnameplaceholder der Graaf is a democracy, but believe me, it's entirely democratic, with everyone having very vocal and forceful opinions."[76] Since the band has stabilised around Hammill, Banton and Jackson, the members think there is a good balance of opinion, with somebody always having the casting vote.[90]\n

Hammill and Banton both reject this comparison, with Hammill noting that Genesis were far more driven to be commercially successful, whereas he prefers to release music without interference from record companies. In particular, he has mentioned that while he himself continues to release albums on a regular basis in the 21st century, Peter Gabriel's "average output has been about 0.2 albums a year".[95]\n

It wasn't just Peter's snarling operatic vocal, it was the mix of instruments ... I became an instant fan."[98] Mentioning their reputation as something of an acquired taste, Lydon said, "There's a few firstnameplaceholder der Graaf things I like, but I'm not going to recommend anything to anyone. It might not be for them. Music doesn't come with a set of guidelines."[99] Bruce Dickinson – a fan of the band since he saw them at Oundle School aged 13 – hailed Hammill as one of his childhood heroes.[98]\n

The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, secondnameplaceholder released The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of secondnameplaceholder's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, secondnameplaceholder continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n

During this period he often spent time at Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.[32] There secondnameplaceholder met Hank Cochran, a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard secondnameplaceholder during a jam session with Buddy Emmons and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay secondnameplaceholder the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing secondnameplaceholder sing "Hello Walls" at Tootsie's, Faron Young decided to record it.[33] After Ray Price recorded secondnameplaceholder's "Night Life", and his previous bassist Johnny Paycheck quit, secondnameplaceholder joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the Cherokee Cowboys, his songs became hits for other artists, including "Funny How Time Slips Away" (Billy Walker), "Pretty Paper" (Roy Orbison), and, most famously, "Crazy" by Patsy Cline.[24] secondnameplaceholder and Cochran also met Cline's husband, Charlie Dick at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of secondnameplaceholder's he heard on the bar's jukebox. secondnameplaceholder played him a demo tape of "Crazy." Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.[6] "Crazy" became the biggest jukebox hit of all time.[34]\n

The album led secondnameplaceholder to a new style, later stating that Shotgun firstnameplaceholder had "cleared his throat".[50] His next release, Phases and Stages, released in 1974, was a concept album about a couple's divorce, inspired by his own experience. Side one of the record is from the viewpoint of the woman, and side two is from the viewpoint of the man.[51] The album included the hit single "Bloody Mary Morning".[52] The same year, he produced and starred in the pilot episode of PBS' Austin City Limits.[53]\n

Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, secondnameplaceholder and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of Fred Rose's 1945 song "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain", that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became secondnameplaceholder's first number one hit as a singer.[55] Throughout his 1975 tour, secondnameplaceholder raised funds for PBS-affiliated stations across the south promoting Austin City Limits. The pilot was aired first on those stations, later being released nationwide. The positive reception of the show prompted PBS to order ten episodes for 1976, formally launching the show.[56]\n
